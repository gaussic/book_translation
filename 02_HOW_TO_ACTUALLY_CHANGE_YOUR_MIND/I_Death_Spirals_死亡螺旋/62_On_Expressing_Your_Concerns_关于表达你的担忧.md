## 关于表达你的担忧

阿希从众实验最可怕的地方在于：如果你把很多人放在一个房间里，让他们都说“黑就是白”，你真的能让许多人也跟着这么说。阿希实验中令人欣慰的一点是，只要有一个人持不同意见，从众率就会大幅下降——即使这个异见者只是给出了另一个错误答案。而令人沮丧的是，这种异见并不会在实验过程中被大家学会——一旦唯一的异见者开始顺从群体，从众率又会回升。

做异见者确实能给群体带来好处，但这也（众所周知地）有代价。而且你还得坚持下去，并且你也可能是错的。

我最近有一次有趣的经历：我和两位之前已经做过一些规划的人讨论一个项目。我觉得他们太乐观了，于是提出了不少安全边际方面的建议。很快，第四个人路过——他正好要送其中一位回家——也加入了讨论并开始提建议。这时我突然意识到，群体是如何变得过于自信的：每当我提出一个潜在问题，这位第四人总会说“别担心，我相信我们能搞定！”或者类似的安慰话。

一个人单独工作时，会自然地产生怀疑。他会想：“我真的能做成XYZ吗？”——因为怀疑自己的能力并不失礼。但当两个没信心的人组成一个小组时，礼貌的做法是说些好听、让人安心的话，而质疑对方的能力则显得不礼貌。于是他们在一起时比各自单独时都更乐观，每个人的疑虑都被对方表面上的自信安慰所平息，却没意识到对方其实一开始也有同样的内心疑虑。

阿希实验最可怕的可能性在于：每个人都顺从群体，被他人的自信声音所影响，小心翼翼地不让自己的疑虑暴露出来——却没意识到别人也在压抑着类似的担忧。这就是所谓的“多元无知”。

Robin Hanson 和我一直在争论理性主义者到底该在什么时候敢于持不同意见。我倾向于主流观点：你别无选择，只能形成自己的看法。Robin Hanson 则更标新立异，认为你——不仅仅是别人——也应该考虑别人可能更有智慧。无论我们在其他方面怎么争论，我们都同意奥曼协议定理的推论：如果事实性分歧成为共同知识，说明有人一定是不理性的。<sup>1</sup> 尽管我们因此被人投来奇怪的目光，我们还是坚持“谦逊”原则：别管别人怎么鼓吹个人主义，你还是应该关注他人的看法。

咳，总之，对于理性主义者来说，和群体意见不一致是件很严肃的事。你不能用“每个人都有权有自己的观点”来轻描淡写。

我认为，从阿希实验中最重要的教训是要区分“表达担忧”和“反对意见”。提出别人没提到的问题，并不等于承诺最终会和群体意见不一致。

理想贝叶斯主义者的收敛过程，是分享对听众来说不可预测的新证据。奥曼协议定理只适用于共同知识，也就是你知道、我知道、你知道我知道等等。Hanson 关于“We Can’t Foresee to Disagree”的文章或论文，描绘了理想理性主义者如何收敛到概率估计的奇特过程——这和市场上讨价还价双方达成价格的过程完全不同。

不幸的是，在社会层面，“表达担忧”和“反对意见”其实没什么区别。理性主义者小组也许会假装两者有区别，但人类本性并非如此。一旦你说出来，你就做出了社会上不可逆的举动；你成了那个“出头的钉子”，打破了舒适的群体和谐，这无法撤销。任何因为你质疑其完成XYZ任务能力而感到被冒犯的人，即使你最后说“没问题，我还是同意大家的意见”，大概率还是会记仇。

阿希实验表明，异见的力量确实能激励他人。从众的力量也同样真实。如果所有人都不表达自己的私下疑虑，群体确实会陷入疯狂。但历史上也有无数例子说明，成为第一个、甚至第二个说“皇帝没穿衣服”的人，代价有多大。而且人类并没有天生区分“表达担忧”和“即使是共同知识下的反对意见”的能力；这种区分只是理性主义者的技巧。如果你读过更犬儒的自助书（比如马基雅维利的《君主论》），你会发现他们建议你完全隐藏自己的非从众，而不是先表达担忧再同意群体。如果你为群体指出明显的问题，不要指望群体会感谢你。

这就是异见的代价与收益——无论你是“反对”还是只是“表达担忧”——选择权在你手中。

## On Expressing Your Concerns

The scary thing about Asch’s conformity experiments is that you can get many people to say black is white, if you put them in a room full of other people saying the same thing. The hopeful thing about Asch’s conformity experiments is that a single dissenter tremendously drove down the rate of conformity, even if the dissenter was only giving a different wrong answer. And the wearisome thing is that dissent was not learned over the course of the experiment—when the single dissenter started siding with the group, rates of conformity rose back up.

Being a voice of dissent can bring real benefits to the group. But it also (famously) has a cost. And then you have to keep it up. Plus you could be wrong.

I recently had an interesting experience wherein I began discussing a project with two people who had previously done some planning on their own. I thought they were being too optimistic and made a number of safetymargin-type suggestions for the project. Soon a fourth guy wandered by, who was providing one of the other two with a ride home, and began making suggestions. At this point I had a sudden insight about how groups become overconfident, because whenever I raised a possible problem, the fourth guy would say, “Don’t worry, I’m sure we can handle it!” or something similarly reassuring.

An individual, working alone, will have natural doubts. They will think to themselves, “Can I really do XYZ?” because there’s nothing impolite about doubting your own competence. But when two unconfident people form a group, it is polite to say nice and reassuring things, and impolite to question the other person’s competence. Together they become more optimistic than either would be on their own, each one’s doubts quelled by the other’s seemingly confident reassurance, not realizing that the other person initially had the same inner doubts.

The most fearsome possibility raised by Asch’s experiments on conformity is the specter of everyone agreeing with the group, swayed by the confident voices of others, careful not to let their own doubts show—not realizing that others are suppressing similar worries. This is known as “pluralistic ignorance.”

Robin Hanson and I have a long-running debate over when, exactly, aspiring rationalists should dare to disagree. I tend toward the widely held position that you have no real choice but to form your own opinions. Robin Hanson advocates a more iconoclastic position, that you—not just other people—should consider that others may be wiser. Regardless of our various disputes, we both agree that Aumann’s Agreement Theorem extends to imply that common knowledge of a factual disagreement shows someone must be irrational.<sup>1</sup> Despite the funny looks we’ve gotten, we’re sticking to our guns about modesty: Forget what everyone tells you about individualism, you should pay attention to what other people think.

Ahem. The point is that, for rationalists, disagreeing with the group is serious business. You can’t wave it off with, “Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.”

I think the most important lesson to take away from Asch’s experiments is to distinguish “expressing concern” from “disagreement.” Raising a point that others haven’t voiced is not a promise to disagree with the group at the end of its discussion.

The ideal Bayesian’s process of convergence involves sharing evidence that is unpredictable to the listener. The Aumann agreement result holds only for common knowledge, where you know, I know, you know I know, etc. Hanson’s post or paper on “We Can’t Foresee to Disagree” provides a picture of how strange it would look to watch ideal rationalists converging on a probability estimate; it doesn’t look anything like two bargainers in a marketplace converging on a price.

Unfortunately, there’s not much difference socially between “expressing concerns” and “disagreement.” A group of rationalists might agree to pretend there’s a difference, but it’s not how human beings are really wired. Once you speak out, you’ve committed a socially irrevocable act; you’ve become the nail sticking up, the discord in the comfortable group harmony, and you can’t undo that. Anyone insulted by a concern you expressed about their competence to successfully complete task XYZ will probably hold just as much of a grudge afterward if you say, “No problem, I’ll go along with the group,” at the end.

Asch’s experiment shows that the power of dissent to inspire others is real. Asch’s experiment shows that the power of conformity is real. If everyone refrains from voicing their private doubts, that will indeed lead groups into madness. But history abounds with lessons on the price of being the first, or even the second, to say that the Emperor has no clothes. Nor are people hardwired to distinguish “expressing a concern” from “disagreement even with common knowledge”; this distinction is a rationalist’s artifice. If you read the more cynical brand of self-help books (e.g., Machiavelli’s The Prince) they will advise you to mask your nonconformity entirely, not voice your concerns first and then agree at the end. If you perform the group service of being the one who gives voice to the obvious problems, don’t expect the group to thank you for it.

These are the costs and the benefits of dissenting—whether you “disagree” or just “express concern”—and the decision is up to you.
