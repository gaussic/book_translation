## 情感死亡螺旋

在人类推理中，有无数缺陷会让我们高估自己钟爱的理论对事实的解释力。燃素说几乎可以解释任何事情——只要不用它提前做出预测。而你用自己偏爱的理论解释的现象越多，这个理论看起来就越真实——毕竟它不是被许多观察所证实了吗？理论看起来越真实，你就越容易质疑与之冲突的证据。理论看起来越普遍，你就越想用它去解释更多现象。

如果你认识某些人，他们相信比利时秘密控制着美国银行系统，或者他们能用隐形的蓝色灵力找到停车位，这大概就是他们入门的方式。

（只要留心观察，你会发现很多似乎能证实这个理论的现象……）

这种轻信与确认的正反馈循环确实可怕，是科学和日常生活中许多错误的根源。

但和另一种螺旋比起来，这还不算什么——那就是始于强烈正面情感的一击——一种让你感觉极好的想法。

一种能拯救世界的新政治体制。一位伟大、强大、高尚、睿智的领袖。一种能治胃病又能治癌症的神奇灵药。

嘿，为什么不全都来一遍？伟大的事业需要伟大的领袖，伟大的领袖当然能调制出一两种神奇灵药。

光环效应指的是，任何被感知到的正面特质（比如吸引力或力量）都会提升对其他正面特质（比如智慧或勇气）的感知。即使这种联系毫无道理，甚至完全相反。

正面特质会增强对其他所有正面特质的感知？这听起来很像裂变中的铀原子释放中子，进而引发更多铀原子的裂变。

微弱的正面情感是亚临界的，不会失控。一个有吸引力的人看起来更诚实，也许这又让他看起来更有吸引力；但有效的“中子增殖因子”小于1。打个比方说，正反馈会有些共振，但很快就会消散。

但如果强烈的正面情感附着在“伟大事物”上，这种共振就会无处不在。一个坚定的共产主义者能在麦当劳买汉堡时看到马克思的智慧；在自己没被提拔、而在真正的工人天堂本该属于自己的职位时；在每一次不如意的选举结果里；在每一篇“方向不对”的新闻报道中。每当他们用“伟大思想”去解释一个新事件，“伟大思想”就被进一步证实。这感觉更好——正向强化——而且，遗憾的是，感觉越好，我们就越想相信它。

当“伟大事物”让你不断主动寻找机会，用它来解释每天的新事件，让你感觉越来越好时，这种正面情感的共振就像一个装满了带乒乓球的捕鼠夹的房间。

你可以叫它“幸福吸引子”“过度正反馈”“赞美锁闭回路”或“快乐纸”。我个人更喜欢“情感死亡螺旋”这个说法。

## Affective Death Spirals

Many, many, many are the flaws in human reasoning which lead us to overestimate how well our beloved theory explains the facts. The phlogiston theory of chemistry could explain just about anything, so long as it didn’t have to predict it in advance. And the more phenomena you use your favored theory to explain, the truer your favored theory seems—has it not been confirmed by these many observations? As the theory seems truer, you will be more likely to question evidence that conflicts with it. As the favored theory seems more general, you will seek to use it in more explanations.

If you know anyone who believes that Belgium secretly controls the US banking system, or that they can use an invisible blue spirit force to detect available parking spaces, that’s probably how they got started.

(Just keep an eye out, and you’ll observe much that seems to confirm this theory . . .)

This positive feedback cycle of credulity and confirmation is indeed fearsome, and responsible for much error, both in science and in everyday life.

But it’s nothing compared to the death spiral that begins with a charge of positive affect—a thought that feels really good.

A new political system that can save the world. A great leader, strong and noble and wise. An amazing tonic that can cure upset stomachs and cancer.

Heck, why not go for all three? A great cause needs a great leader. A great leader should be able to brew up a magical tonic or two.

The halo effect is that any perceived positive characteristic (such as attractiveness or strength) increases perception of any other positive characteristic (such as intelligence or courage). Even when it makes no sense, or less than no sense.

Positive characteristics enhance perception of every other positive characteristic? That sounds a lot like how a fissioning uranium atom sends out neutrons that fission other uranium atoms.

Weak positive affect is subcritical; it doesn’t spiral out of control. An attractive person seems more honest, which, perhaps, makes them seem more attractive; but the effective neutron multiplication factor is less than one. Metaphorically speaking. The resonance confuses things a little, but then dies out.

With intense positive affect attached to the Great Thingy, the resonance touches everywhere. A believing Communist sees the wisdom of Marx in every hamburger bought at McDonald’s; in every promotion they’re denied that would have gone to them in a true worker’s paradise; in every election that doesn’t go to their taste; in every newspaper article “slanted in the wrong direction.” Every time they use the Great Idea to interpret another event, the Great Idea is confirmed all the more. It feels better—positive reinforcement—and of course, when something feels good, that, alas, makes us want to believe it all the more.

When the Great Thingy feels good enough to make you seek out new opportunities to feel even better about the Great Thingy, applying it to interpret new events every day, the resonance of positive affect is like a chamber full of mousetraps loaded with ping-pong balls.

You could call it a “happy attractor,” “overly positive feedback,” a “praise locked loop,” or “funpaper.” Personally I prefer the term “affective death spiral.”
