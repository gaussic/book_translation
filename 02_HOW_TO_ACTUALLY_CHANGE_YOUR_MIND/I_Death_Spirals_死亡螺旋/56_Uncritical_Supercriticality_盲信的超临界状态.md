## 盲信的超临界状态

每隔一段时间，你总能看到人们争论无神论到底算不算一种“宗教”。正如我在另一篇文章《目的与实用主义》中提到的，为词语的定义而争论，几乎总是意味着你已经偏离了最初的问题。<sup>1</sup> 那么，这场争论最初是如何产生的呢？

一位无神论者在高谈阔论，将宗教裁判所、十字军东征以及各种与伊斯兰有关的冲突归咎于“宗教”。有宗教信仰的一方可能会反驳：“但无神论也是一种宗教，因为你对上帝也有信念；你相信上帝不存在。”然后无神论者回答：“如果无神论是宗教，那不集邮也是一种爱好了。”于是争论便开始了。

或者，有宗教信仰的一方可能会回答：“但斯大林，一个无神论者，以无神论之名镇压教会，也犯下了同样巨大的恐怖罪行；因此，你将暴力归咎于宗教是错误的。”现在，无神论者可能会忍不住使用“没有真正的苏格兰人”这个逻辑谬误，说：“斯大林的宗教是共产主义。”信教者则反驳：“如果共产主义是宗教，那《星球大战》的粉丝圈就是一个政府了。”于是争论又开始了。

我们应该将“有宗教信仰”的人定义为对至少一位神的存在有明确看法的人吗？例如，认为宙斯存在的概率低于10%或高于90%？还是说，应该将其定义为对至少一位神的存在持积极看法（比如，概率高于90%）的人？在前一种情况下，斯大林是“有宗教信仰的”；在后一种情况下，斯大林则“没有宗教信仰”。

但这正是看待这个问题的错误方式。你真正想知道的——争论最初的核心——是为什么在人类历史的某些时刻，大批的人会以某种思想的名义被屠杀和折磨。重新定义一个词语，并不会改变历史事实分毫。

共产主义是一场复杂的灾难，其成因可能不止一个，因果链中可能没有哪个单一环节是关键。但如果我必须指出一个源头性的错误，那么……好吧，我让上帝来替我说：

如果你的弟兄，你父亲或母亲的儿子，或是你的儿女，或是你怀中的配偶，或是你最亲密的朋友，暗中引诱你，说：“我们去侍奉别的神吧”，那些你和你祖先素不认识的神，那些你周围各民族的神，无论是近处的还是远方的，遍及世界任何地方的神，你都不可同意，不可听从；你不可怜悯他，不可姑息他，也不可包庇他的罪。不，你必须杀死他，你必须亲手下第一击将他处死，然后由其余众人接着下手。你必须用石头砸死他，因为他企图引诱你背离耶和华你的神。

——《申命记》13:7–11，黑体为译者所加

这同样是斯大林为共产主义、希特勒为纳粹主义定下的规则：如果你的兄弟试图告诉你马克思为什么是错的，如果你的儿子试图告诉你犹太人并没有在谋划征服世界，那么不要与他辩论，也不要陈述你自己的证据；不要进行可重复的实验或审视历史；而是立刻把他交给秘密警察。

我曾建议，抵制“情感死亡螺旋”的一个关键原则是“繁琐细节”原则——就是提醒自己去质疑每一个关于“伟大理念”的悦耳说法的具体细节。<sup>2</sup> 这虽不能消除光环效应，但有望将其共振强度降到临界点以下，使得平均一个听起来不错的说法，所引发的额外的好听说法少于1.0个。

与此建议截然相反的，则是将光环效应推向超临界状态的做法，即当你觉得反驳任何关于“伟大理念”的正面说法都是错误的时候。

政治是心智杀手。论点即士兵。 一旦你知道自己站在哪一边，你就必须支持所有有利的论断，并反驳所有不利的论断。否则，这就像是在资助和安慰敌人，或是在背后捅朋友刀子。

如果……

……你觉得反驳他人为进化论提出的一个有缺陷的好听论点，会是给神创论者送温暖、帮大忙；

……你觉得每说一句关于上帝的好话，都能积攒灵性功德，而争论会干扰你与上帝的关系；

……你有一种明确的感觉，如果你反驳最近的这场战争，房间里的其他人会因为你“不支持我们的军队”而讨厌你；

……说任何反对共产主义的话都会让你被石头砸死……被枪毙；

……那么，情感死亡螺旋已经进入了超临界状态。它现在是一个“超级快乐死亡螺旋”。

回到我们最初的问题——“是什么导致了大屠杀？”——需要关注的关键类别并非宗教本身。我听过的对“超自然”和“自然主义”世界观最好的区分是：超自然世界观断言存在本体论上基本的精神实体，如灵魂；而自然主义世界观则将精神现象还原为非精神的部分。将焦点放在这一点上作为问题的根源，其实是陷入了宗教例外论。超自然的说法确实值得区分，因为它们总是因为某些相当根本的原因而被证明是错误的。<sup>3</sup> 但这终究只是一种错误。

情感死亡螺旋可以围绕超自然信仰形成——特别是那些其顶点是一位“超级快乐代理人”（其主要定义就是，任何关于它的好话都是对的）的一神教，尤其是那些已经演化得足够复杂，能够宣称不信者会遭受超自然惩罚的模因复合体。但死亡螺旋也可以围绕一项政治创新、一位魅力型领袖、一种对种族命运的信仰或一个经济学假说而启动。历史的教训是，无论情感死亡螺旋是否碰巧涉及超自然主义，它都是危险的。作为一个错误类别，宗教并没有特殊到成为关键问题的地步。

萨姆·哈里斯（Sam Harris）将矛头指向“信仰”，这更接近问题的核心。如果你不对每一个额外的好听说法施加适当的举证责任，情感共振就很容易启动。看看那些可怜的新纪元（New Agers）信徒吧。基督教发展出了抵御批评的防御机制，鼓吹信仰的奇妙之处；新纪元运动在文化上继承了“信仰是积极的”这一现成思想，却缺乏基督教那样排他性的经文来抵挡相互竞争的模因。结果，新纪元信徒们围绕着星星、树木、磁铁、饮食、咒语、独角兽……陷入了快乐的死亡螺旋。

但是，当批评变成了一种罪过，或是一种失言，或是一种罪行时，情感死亡螺旋会变得致命得多。 这个世界上有些东西值得大力赞扬，你不能简单地说超过某个点的赞扬就是被禁止的。但绝没有一个理念是如此正确，以至于批评任何支持它的论据都是错误的。绝不。永永远远，绝不。这是绝对的。在一个非平凡的答案空间里，绝大多数可能的信念是错误的，同样，对于一个正确的信念，绝大多数可能的支持论据也是错误的，即使是再快乐的理念也无法改变这一点。

并且，以暴力回应批评是三重、究极、绝对禁止的。 在人类理性的艺术中，有极少数几条禁令是没有任何“如果”、“而且”、“但是”或例外条款的。这就是其中之一。坏的论证用反论证来回应。而不是用子弹。绝不。永永远远，绝不。

## Uncritical Supercriticality

Every now and then, you see people arguing over whether atheism is a “religion.” As I touch on elsewhere, in “Purpose and Pragmatism,” arguing over the meaning of a word nearly always means that you’ve lost track of the original question.<sup>1</sup> How might this argument arise to begin with?

An atheist is holding forth, blaming “religion” for the Inquisition, the Crusades, and various conflicts with or within Islam. The religious one may reply, “But atheism is also a religion, because you also have beliefs about God; you believe God doesn’t exist.” Then the atheist answers, “If atheism is a religion, then not collecting stamps is a hobby,” and the argument begins.

Or the one may reply, “But horrors just as great were inflicted by Stalin, who was an atheist, and who suppressed churches in the name of atheism; therefore you are wrong to blame the violence on religion.” Now the atheist may be tempted to reply, “No true Scotsman,” saying, “Stalin’s religion was Communism.” The religious one answers “If Communism is a religion, then Star Wars fandom is a government,” and the argument begins.

Should a “religious” person be defined as someone who has a definite opinion about the existence of at least one God, e.g., assigning a probability lower than 10% or higher than 90% to the existence of Zeus? Or should a “religious” person be defined as someone who has a positive opinion (say, a probability higher than 90%) on the existence of at least one God? In the former case, Stalin was “religious”; in the latter case, Stalin was “not religious.”

But this is exactly the wrong way to look at the problem. What you really want to know—what the argument was originally about—is why, at certain points in human history, large groups of people were slaughtered and tortured, ostensibly in the name of an idea. Redefining a word won’t change the facts of history one way or the other.

Communism was a complex catastrophe, and there may be no single why, no single critical link in the chain of causality. But if I had to suggest an ur-mistake, it would be . . . well, I’ll let God say it for me:

	If your brother, the son of your father or of your mother, or your son or daughter, or the spouse whom you embrace, or your most intimate friend, tries to secretly seduce you, saying, “Let us go and serve other gods,” unknown to you or your ancestors before you, gods of the peoples surrounding you, whether near you or far away, anywhere throughout the world, you must not consent, you must not listen to him; you must show him no pity, you must not spare him or conceal his guilt. No, you must kill him, your hand must strike the first blow in putting him to death and the hands of the rest of the people following. You must stone him to death, since he has tried to divert you from Yahweh your God.

	—Deuteronomy 13:7–11, emphasis added

This was likewise the rule which Stalin set for Communism, and Hitler for Nazism: if your brother tries to tell you why Marx is wrong, if your son tries to tell you the Jews are not planning world conquest, then do not debate him or set forth your own evidence; do not perform replicable experiments or examine history; but turn him in at once to the secret police.

I suggested that one key to resisting an affective death spiral is the principle of “burdensome details”—just remembering to question the specific details of each additional nice claim about the Great Idea.<sup>2</sup> This wouldn’t get rid of the halo effect, but it would hopefully reduce the resonance to below criticality, so that one nice-sounding claim triggers less than 1.0 additional nice-sounding claims, on average.

The diametric opposite of this advice, which sends the halo effect supercritical, is when it feels wrong to argue against any positive claim about the Great Idea.

Politics is the mind-killer. Arguments are soldiers. Once you know which side you’re on, you must support all favorable claims, and argue against all unfavorable claims. Otherwise it’s like giving aid and comfort to the enemy, or stabbing your friends in the back.

If . . .

- . . . you feel that contradicting someone else who makes a flawed nice claim in favor of evolution would be giving aid and comfort to the creationists;
- . . . you feel like you get spiritual credit for each nice thing you say about God, and arguing about it would interfere with your relationship with God;
- . . . you have the distinct sense that the other people in the room will dislike you for “not supporting our troops” if you argue against the latest war;
- . . . saying anything against Communism gets you stoned to death shot;

. . . then the affective death spiral has gone supercritical. It is now a Super Happy Death Spiral.

When it comes to our original question—“What makes the slaughter?”— the key category to pay attention to isn’t religion as such. The best distinction I’ve heard between “supernatural” and “naturalistic” worldviews is that a supernatural worldview asserts the existence of ontologically basic mental substances, like spirits, while a naturalistic worldview reduces mental phenomena to nonmental parts. Focusing on this as the source of the problem buys into religious exceptionalism. Supernaturalist claims are worth distinguishing, because they always turn out to be wrong for fairly fundamental reasons.<sup>3</sup> But it’s still just one kind of mistake.

An affective death spiral can nucleate around supernatural beliefs— particularly monotheisms whose pinnacle is a Super Happy Agent, defined primarily by agreeing with any nice statement about it—and particularly meme complexes grown sophisticated enough to assert supernatural punishments for disbelief. But the death spiral can also start around a political innovation, a charismatic leader, belief in racial destiny, or an economic hypothesis. The lesson of history is that affective death spirals are dangerous whether or not they happen to involve supernaturalism. Religion isn’t special enough, as a class of mistake, to be the key problem.

Sam Harris came closer when he put the accusing finger on faith. If you don’t place an appropriate burden of proof on each and every additional nice claim, the affective resonance gets started very easily. Look at the poor New Agers. Christianity developed defenses against criticism, arguing for the wonders of faith; New Agers culturally inherit the cached thought that faith is positive, but lack Christianity’s exclusionary scripture to keep out competing memes. New Agers end up in happy death spirals around stars, trees, magnets, diets, spells, unicorns . . .

But the affective death spiral turns much deadlier after criticism becomes a sin, or a gaffe, or a crime. There are things in this world that are worth praising greatly, and you can’t flatly say that praise beyond a certain point is forbidden. But there is never an Idea so true that it’s wrong to criticize any argument that supports it. Never. Never ever never for ever. That is flat. The vast majority of possible beliefs in a nontrivial answer space are false, and likewise, the vast majority of possible supporting arguments for a true belief are also false, and not even the happiest idea can change that.

And it is triple ultra forbidden to respond to criticism with violence. There are a very few injunctions in the human art of rationality that have no ifs, ands, buts, or escape clauses. This is one of them. Bad argument gets counterargument. Does not get bullet. Never. Never ever never for ever.
