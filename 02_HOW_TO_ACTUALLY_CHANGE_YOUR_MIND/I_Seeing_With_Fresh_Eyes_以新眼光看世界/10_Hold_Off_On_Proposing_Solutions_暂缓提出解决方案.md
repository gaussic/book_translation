## 暂缓提出解决方案

> Norman R. F. Maier 观察到，当一个小组面临问题时，其成员的自然倾向是开始讨论问题时便提出可能的解决方案。因此，小组的互动会集中于所提解决方案的优点和问题，成员们会对自己提出的方案产生情感依附，而更优的方案却难以被提出。为了增强小组问题解决能力，Maier 制定了一个指令：“**在问题彻底讨论完之前，不要提出解决方案。**”在那些问题的好解决方案是客观定义的情境中，这一指令的效果是显而易见的。

> 为了展示这一点，Maier 设计了以下的“角色扮演”实验：三名能力不同的员工在一个生产线上工作。他们轮换着做三项不同难度的工作，因为最能干的员工——同时也是最具支配力的员工——强烈希望避免无聊。相反，最不擅长的员工意识到自己做的较难工作远不如其他两位同事，因此他同意进行轮换，因为他的能力较强的同事在团队中占主导地位。一名“效率专家”注意到，如果将最能干的员工分配到最困难的任务，最不擅长的员工分配到最简单的任务，生产效率可以提高20%，因此建议员工停止轮换。三名员工和一名指定扮演领班角色的第四人被要求讨论专家的建议。有些角色扮演小组被告知，在彻底讨论问题之前不得讨论解决方案，而另一些则没有。没有收到指令的小组立即开始争论生产力与员工自主权以及避免无聊之间的重要性。而那些收到指令的小组则更有可能得出最能干的两名员工轮换工作，而最不擅长的员工保持在最简单的岗位上——这一解决方案能带来19%的生产力提升。

> 我在带领小组时常常使用这个指令——**尤其是在他们面临一个非常棘手的问题时，因为正是在这种情况下，小组成员最容易立刻提出解决方案**。虽然我没有客观标准来评判这些小组问题解决的质量，但 Maier 的指令似乎确实有助于找到更好的问题解决方案。

这一点简直太真实了，简直不敢相信。而且问题越复杂，情况就越糟。以人工智能为例。我遇到的许多人似乎都知道如何构建人工通用智能，而他们可能连如何构建一个光学字符识别系统或协同过滤系统（这些问题要简单得多）都不知道。至于构建一个对世界产生积极影响的人工智能——一个友好的人工智能，笼统来说——哇，这个问题难度之大，简直让大多数人在十五秒内就能解决整个问题。<sup>2</sup> 真是开玩笑。

这个问题不仅仅是人工智能领域的问题。物理学家会遇到很多非物理学家提出的物理理论，经济学家会听到大量新奇的经济学理论。如果你是进化生物学家，任何你遇到的人似乎都能立刻解决你领域中的任何开放性问题，通常通过假设群体选择。等等。

Maier 的建议呼应了底线原则：我们决策的有效性仅由我们在做出决策时所依据的证据和思维过程决定——在你写下结论之后，再写更多理由已经太晚了。如果你在很早的时候做出了决策，那么它实际上是基于非常少的思考，无论你后来提出多少惊人的论点。

再者，考虑到我们改变想法的频率远低于我们认为的：24个人对未来选择的概率给出了平均66%的预期，但只有1/24的人实际上选择了他们认为较不可能的选项。**一旦你能猜到你的答案，实际上你可能已经做出了决定**。如果你在听到问题后半秒钟就能猜到答案，那么你只有半秒钟的时间来做出聪明的反应。而这可不多。

传统理性强调的是证伪——在面对明显反证时放弃初步观点的能力。但一旦一个想法进入你的脑海，可能需要大量的证据才能把它排除。更糟糕的是，我们并不总是有压倒性证据的奢侈。

我怀疑，更强大（而且更困难）的方法是暂停，延缓给出答案的时机。延长我们无法预测答案的那一小段时间；从而给我们的智慧更多的时间去发挥。

即便是半分钟，也比半秒钟要强得多。

## Hold Off On Proposing Solutions

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

From Robyn Dawes’s Rational Choice in an Uncertain World.<sup>1</sup> Bolding added.

> Norman R. F. Maier noted that when a group faces a problem, the natural tendency of its members is to propose possible solutions as they begin to discuss the problem. Consequently, the group interaction focuses on the merits and problems of the proposed solutions, people become emotionally attached to the ones they have suggested, and superior solutions are not suggested. Maier enacted an edict to enhance group problem solving: “**Do not propose solutions until the problem has been discussed as thoroughly as possible without suggesting any.**” It is easy to show that this edict works in contexts where there are objectively defined good solutions to problems.
> 
> Maier devised the following “role playing” experiment to demonstrate his point. Three employees of differing ability work on an assembly line. They rotate among three jobs that require different levels of ability, because the most able—who is also the most dominant—is strongly motivated to avoid boredom. In contrast, the least able worker, aware that he does not perform the more difficult jobs as well as the other two, has agreed to rotation because of the dominance of his able co-worker. An “efficiency expert” notes that if the most able employee were given the most difficult task and the least able the least difficult, productivity could be improved by 20%, and the expert recommends that the employees stop rotating. The three employees and . . . a fourth person designated to play the role of foreman are asked to discuss the expert’s recommendation. Some role-playing groups are given Maier’s edict not to discuss solutions until having discussed the problem thoroughly, while others are not. Those who are not given the edict immediately begin to argue about the importance of productivity versus worker autonomy and the avoidance of boredom. Groups presented with the edict have a much higher probability of arriving at the solution that the two more able workers rotate, while the least able one sticks to the least demanding job—a solution that yields a 19% increase in productivity.
> 
> I have often used this edict with groups I have led—**particularly when they face a very tough problem, which is when group members are most apt to propose solutions immediately**. While I have no objective criterion on which to judge the quality of the problem solving of the groups, Maier’s edict appears to foster better solutions to problems.

This is so true it’s not even funny. And it gets worse and worse the tougher the problem becomes. Take artificial intelligence, for example. A surprising number of people I meet seem to know exactly how to build an artificial general intelligence, without, say, knowing how to build an optical character recognizer or a collaborative filtering system (much easier problems). And as for building an AI with a positive impact on the world—a Friendly AI, loosely speaking—why, that problem is so incredibly difficult that an actual majority resolve the whole issue within fifteen seconds.<sup>2</sup> Give me a break.

This problem is by no means unique to AI. Physicists encounter plenty of nonphysicists with their own theories of physics, economists get to hear lots of amazing new theories of economics. If you’re an evolutionary biologist, anyone you meet can instantly solve any open problem in your field, usually by postulating group selection. Et cetera.

Maier’s advice echoes the principle of the bottom line, that the effectiveness of our decisions is determined only by whatever evidence and processing we did in first arriving at our decisions—after you write the bottom line, it is too late to write more reasons above. If you make your decision very early on, it will, in fact, be based on very little thought, no matter how many amazing arguments you come up with afterward.

And consider furthermore that we change our minds less often than we think: 24 people assigned an average 66% probability to the future choice thought more probable, but only 1 in 24 actually chose the option thought less probable. **Once you can guess what your answer will be, you have probably already decided**. If you can guess your answer half a second after hearing the question, then you have half a second in which to be intelligent. It’s not a lot of time.

Traditional Rationality emphasizes falsification—the ability to relinquish an initial opinion when confronted by clear evidence against it. But once an idea gets into your head, it will probably require way too much evidence to get it out again. Worse, we don’t always have the luxury of overwhelming evidence.

I suspect that a more powerful (and more difficult) method is to hold off on thinking of an answer. To suspend, draw out, that tiny moment when we can’t yet guess what our answer will be; thus giving our intelligence a longer time in which to act.

Even half a minute would be an improvement over half a second.
