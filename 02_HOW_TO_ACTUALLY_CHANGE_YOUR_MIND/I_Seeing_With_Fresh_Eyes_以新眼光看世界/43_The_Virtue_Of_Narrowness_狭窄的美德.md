## 狭窄的美德

　　一个苹果上成立的事实，未必适用于另一个苹果；因此，你能对一个苹果说的，比对全世界所有苹果说的还要多。

　　——《理性的十二美德》

在各自的专业领域内，人们都明白“狭窄”有多重要；修车工知道化油器和散热器的区别，绝不会把它们都当成“汽车零件”。采猎者分得清狮子和美洲豹。清洁工不会用玻璃清洁剂擦地板——即使瓶子在外行人看来很像。

可一旦离开自己的专业领域，人们常常犯下一个错误：试图把一个词尽可能地扩展，覆盖尽可能多的范围。难道谈论全世界所有苹果，不比只谈一个苹果更光荣、更智慧、更令人印象深刻吗？解释人类思维的全部，不比被诸如“人类如何发明魔方解法”这样的小问题分心更高尚吗？事实上，似乎根本没必要考虑具体问题；难道一个通用理论本身还不够伟大吗？

好奇者的方式，是从海滩上无数鹅卵石中捡起一颗，发现它有些新奇、有趣、与众不同的地方。你把这些鹅卵石称为“钻石”，并追问它们有什么特别之处——除了最初注意到的闪光之外，它们是否有某种内在的共同特质。然后，总会有人走过来说：“为什么不把这颗鹅卵石也叫钻石？还有这颗，这颗呢？”他们很热情，也出于好意。毕竟，只叫一部分鹅卵石“钻石”，而其他的不叫，似乎不够民主、不够包容、不够整体。似乎……有点狭隘……请原谅我用这个词。好像不够开放、不够拥抱、不够群体。

你可能觉得，把一个词赋予多重含义很有诗意，这样可以让各种色彩的联想四处蔓延。但即使是优秀的诗人，也必须学会精确地看待世界。仅仅把爱比作花还不够。炽热、嫉妒、未得圆满的爱，与一对结婚数十年的夫妻之爱并不相同。如果你需要用花来象征嫉妒之爱，你就得走进花园，仔细分辨——找一朵香气浓烈、色彩鲜艳、带刺的花。即使你的目的是渲染意义、投射联想，你也必须精确地记录你到底渲染和联想了哪些意义。

无论是理性主义者的艺术，还是诗人的艺术，都必须专注于那些具有特殊品质的、与众不同的鹅卵石。要仔细观察这些鹅卵石——只有这些鹅卵石！——之间的共同点。这并不是罪过。

现代进化生物学家只解释生物的模式，而不解释恒星的“演化”或技术的“演化”，这完全没问题。可惜有些人用“演化”这个词，既指自然选择下的生命模式，也指恒星的偶然结构，甚至指技术的智能设计结构。众所周知，只要大家用同一个词，那它们就一定是同一回事。这些生物学家一定是太笨，没看出其中的联系。

还有什么比“发现联系”更美德高尚呢？当然，最有智慧的人就是那些新时代大师，他们说：“万物皆有联系。”如果你大声说出这句话，最好停顿一下，让大家好好体会这份深奥的智慧。

完全连通的图与完全无边的图之间有一个平凡的映射。一个每两个顶点之间都有边的完全图，和一个没有任何边的图，所包含的信息量是一样的。重要的图，是那些有些事物彼此不相连的图。

当未开悟者试图装深沉时，他们会在这个话题和那个话题之间画无穷无尽的类比，这个像那个，那个又像另一个……直到他们的图变成完全连通，也就完全无用了。解决之道是具体知识和深入研究。当你理解得足够细致，你就能看出它们哪里不同，并开始兴致勃勃地从你的图上删边。

同样，重要的类别是那些不包含宇宙中一切事物的类别。好的假说只能解释某些可能的结果，而不能解释其他结果。

牛顿只解释了重力、物体下落的方式、行星绕太阳公转、月亮引潮力，而没有解释金钱在社会中的作用或心脏如何泵血，这完全没问题。嘲笑“狭窄”，让我想起古希腊人认为亲自观察事物是体力劳动，而体力劳动是奴隶干的。

正如柏拉图在《理想国》第七卷中所说：

　　如果有人仰头望天，通过凝视天花板上的各种图案学到些什么，你大概会以为他是在用理性思考，其实他只是用眼睛在看……我相信，只有研究真实存在和不可见之物的学问，才能让灵魂仰望高处。无论他是仰头凝视，还是低头沉思，只要他试图通过感官去了解事物，我都说他永远学不到什么，因为这些东西都无法被真正认识：我说他的灵魂是在向下看，而不是向上看，即使他仰面躺在陆地或海上！

今天，许多人也犯着类似的错误，认为狭窄的概念就像亲自观察事物一样低贱、不高尚、不哲学——那是下层阶级才做的事。但理性主义者——还有诗人——需要狭窄的词语来表达精确的思想；他们需要只包含某些事物、排除其他事物的类别。专注、收窄类别、排除可能性、锐化命题，这没有任何问题。真的没有！如果你的词太宽泛，最终你得到的既不真实，也成不了好诗。

还有，那些把维基百科当作“人工智能”、把LSD的发明当作“奇点”、把公司当作“超级智能”的人……我就不吐槽了！

## The Virtue of Narrowness

	What is true of one apple may not be true of another apple; thus more can be said about a single apple than about all the apples in the world.

	—“The Twelve Virtues of Rationality”

Within their own professions, people grasp the importance of narrowness; a car mechanic knows the difference between a carburetor and a radiator, and would not think of them both as “car parts.” A hunter-gatherer knows the difference between a lion and a panther. A janitor does not wipe the floor with window cleaner, even if the bottles look similar to one who has not mastered the art.

Outside their own professions, people often commit the misstep of trying to broaden a word as widely as possible, to cover as much territory as possible. Is it not more glorious, more wise, more impressive, to talk about all the apples in the world? How much loftier it must be to explain human thought in general, without being distracted by smaller questions, such as how humans invent techniques for solving a Rubik’s Cube. Indeed, it scarcely seems necessary to consider specific questions at all; isn’t a general theory a worthy enough accomplishment on its own?

It is the way of the curious to lift up one pebble from among a million pebbles on the shore, and see something new about it, something interesting, something different. You call these pebbles “diamonds,” and ask what might be special about them—what inner qualities they might have in common, beyond the glitter you first noticed. And then someone else comes along and says: “Why not call this pebble a diamond too? And this one, and this one?” They are enthusiastic, and they mean well. For it seems undemocratic and exclusionary and elitist and unholistic to call some pebbles “diamonds,” and others not. It seems . . . narrow-minded . . . if you’ll pardon the phrase. Hardly open, hardly embracing, hardly communal.

You might think it poetic, to give one word many meanings, and thereby spread shades of connotation all around. But even poets, if they are good poets, must learn to see the world precisely. It is not enough to compare love to a flower. Hot jealous unconsummated love is not the same as the love of a couple married for decades. If you need a flower to symbolize jealous love, you must go into the garden, and look, and make subtle distinctions—find a flower with a heady scent, and a bright color, and thorns. Even if your intent is to shade meanings and cast connotations, you must keep precise track of exactly which meanings you shade and connote.

It is a necessary part of the rationalist’s art—or even the poet’s art!—to focus narrowly on unusual pebbles which possess some special quality. And look at the details which those pebbles—and those pebbles alone!—share among each other. This is not a sin.

It is perfectly all right for modern evolutionary biologists to explain just the patterns of living creatures, and not the “evolution” of stars or the “evolution” of technology. Alas, some unfortunate souls use the same word “evolution” to cover the naturally selected patterns of replicating life, and the strictly accidental structure of stars, and the intelligently configured structure of technology. And as we all know, if people use the same word, it must all be the same thing. These biologists must just be too dumb to see the connections.

And what could be more virtuous than seeing connections? Surely the wisest of all human beings are the New Age gurus who say, “Everything is connected to everything else.” If you ever say this aloud, you should pause, so that everyone can absorb the sheer shock of this Deep Wisdom.

There is a trivial mapping between a graph and its complement. A fully connected graph, with an edge between every two vertices, conveys the same amount of information as a graph with no edges at all. The important graphs are the ones where some things are not connected to some other things.

When the unenlightened ones try to be profound, they draw endless verbal comparisons between this topic, and that topic, which is like this, which is like that; until their graph is fully connected and also totally useless. The remedy is specific knowledge and in-depth study. When you understand things in detail, you can see how they are not alike, and start enthusiastically subtracting edges off your graph.

Likewise, the important categories are the ones that do not contain everything in the universe. Good hypotheses can only explain some possible outcomes, and not others.

It was perfectly all right for Isaac Newton to explain just gravity, just the way things fall down—and how planets orbit the Sun, and how the Moon generates the tides—but not the role of money in human society or how the heart pumps blood. Sneering at narrowness is rather reminiscent of ancient Greeks who thought that going out and actually looking at things was manual labor, and manual labor was for slaves.

As Plato put it in The Republic, Book VII:

	If anyone should throw back his head and learn something by staring at the varied patterns on a ceiling, apparently you would think that he was contemplating with his reason, when he was only staring with his eyes . . . I cannot but believe that no study makes the soul look on high except that which is concerned with real being and the unseen. Whether he gape and stare upwards, or shut his mouth and stare downwards, if it be things of the senses that he tries to learn something about, I declare he never could learn, for none of these things admit of knowledge: I say his soul is looking down, not up, even if he is floating on his back on land or on sea!

Many today make a similar mistake, and think that narrow concepts are as lowly and unlofty and unphilosophical as, say, going out and looking at things—an endeavor only suited to the underclass. But rationalists—and also poets—need narrow words to express precise thoughts; they need categories that include only some things, and exclude others. There’s nothing wrong with focusing your mind, narrowing your categories, excluding possibilities, and sharpening your propositions. Really, there isn’t! If you make your words too broad, you end up with something that isn’t true and doesn’t even make good poetry.

And DON’T EVEN GET ME STARTED on people who think Wikipedia is an “Artificial Intelligence,” the invention of LSD was a “Singularity,” or that corporations are “superintelligent”!
