## 我们改变主意的频率远低于自以为

　　过去几年里，我们悄悄地找了一些正面临工作选择的同事，让他们估算自己选择某份工作的概率。对自己预测的选择的平均信心只有66%，但24位受访者中，只有1人最终选择了自己最初认为概率较低的那个选项，总体准确率高达96%。

当我第一次读到上面这段话——2003年8月1日下午3点左右——它改变了我的思考方式。我意识到，一旦我能猜到自己会怎么选——一旦我能给某个选项分配更高的概率——那么很可能我其实已经做出了决定。我们改变主意的频率远低于自己以为。大多数时候，在听到问题后半秒钟内，我们就已经能猜到自己的答案。

那一刻转瞬即逝，我们还无法猜到自己答案的时刻，是智能真正能发挥作用的微小窗口。无论是选择问题，还是事实判断问题，都是如此。

“结论先行”原则认为，只有你信念的真实决定因素，才能决定你作为理性主义者的有效性。一旦你的信念被固定，再多的论证也无法改变其真值；一旦你的决定被固定，再多的论证也无法改变其后果。

你可能会觉得，自己可以用非理性的方式得出一个信念或决定，然后再试图为它辩护，如果发现无法辩护，就放弃它。

但我们改变主意的频率远远——远远——低于自己以为。

我相信你一定能想起自己人生中至少有一次改变主意的经历。我们每个人都可以。但你能想起自己一生中没有改变主意的所有时刻吗？在你对自己理性能力的直觉估算中，这些时刻同样容易被想起吗？

在事后偏见、伪因果、正偏误、锚定/启动效应等等，尤其是可怕的确认偏误的影响下，一旦某个想法进入你的脑海，它很可能就会一直留在那里。

## We Change Our Minds Less Often Than We Think

	Over the past few years, we have discreetly approached colleagues faced with a choice between job offers, and asked them to estimate the probability that they will choose one job over another. The average confidence in the predicted choice was a modest 66%, but only 1 of the 24 respondents chose the option to which he or she initially assigned a lower probability, yielding an overall accuracy rate of 96%.

	—Dale Griffin and Amos Tversky<sup>1</sup>

When I first read the words above—on August 1st, 2003, at around 3 o’clock in the afternoon—it changed the way I thought. I realized that once I could guess what my answer would be—once I could assign a higher probability to deciding one way than other—then I had, in all probability, already decided. We change our minds less often than we think. And most of the time we become able to guess what our answer will be within half a second of hearing the question.

How swiftly that unnoticed moment passes, when we can’t yet guess what our answer will be; the tiny window of opportunity for intelligence to act. In questions of choice, as in questions of fact.

The principle of the bottom line is that only the actual causes of your beliefs determine your effectiveness as a rationalist. Once your belief is fixed, no amount of argument will alter the truth-value; once your decision is fixed, no amount of argument will alter the consequences.

You might think that you could arrive at a belief, or a decision, by nonrational means, and then try to justify it, and if you found you couldn’t justify it, reject it.

But we change our minds less often—much less often—than we think.

I’m sure that you can think of at least one occasion in your life when you’ve changed your mind. We all can. How about all the occasions in your life when you didn’t change your mind? Are they as available, in your heuristic estimate of your competence?

Between hindsight bias, fake causality, positive bias, anchoring/priming, et cetera, et cetera, and above all the dreaded confirmation bias, once an idea gets into your head, it’s probably going to stay there.
