## 启动效应与污染效应

*作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky*

假设你让受试者看到一串字母，如果它组成一个单词就按一个按钮，如果不是单词就按另一个按钮（例如，“banack” vs. “banner”）。然后你给他们看“water”（水）这个词。之后，他们会更快识别“drink”（喝）是一个单词。这被称为“**认知启动效应**”；这一特定形式被称为“**语义启动**”或“**概念启动**”。

启动效应最令人着迷的地方在于它发生在极其低的层次——它加速了人们识别字母是否构成单词的过程，而这显然是在你思考单词含义之前就已完成的步骤。

启动效应也揭示了**激活扩散的强大并行性**：如果看到“water”激活了“drink”，那它可能也激活了“river”（河流）、“cup”（杯子）或“splash”（飞溅）……这种激活通过语义关联从概念扩散开来，一直蔓延到识别字母串的阶段。

启动是**无意识的、无法阻止的**，它是人类神经结构的一个副产品。试图阻止自己被启动，就像试图阻止自己神经回路中的激活扩散。

你可以试试做一组写着颜色名的卡片（比如“Brown”），但颜色名被涂成随机颜色——例如用红色写“Green”，用蓝色写“Yellow”，等等。然后试着大声说出颜色——不是词语的意思，而是文字的颜色。

在 Mussweiler 和 Strack 的实验中，受试者被问了一个“锚定”问题：“德国的年平均气温是高于还是低于 5°C / 20°C？”<sup>1</sup>
随后，在一个单词识别任务中，看到 5°C 锚定的组更快识别“cold”（冷）和“snow”（雪）等词，而高锚定的组则更快识别“hot”（热）和“sun”（太阳）等词。这显示出一种非“调整”机制的锚定效应：**通过启动兼容的思想和记忆来影响判断**。

更广泛的结果是：即使是**完全无信息的、已知是错误的、或完全无关的“信息”**也能影响人们的估计和决策。在“启发式与偏差”这个研究领域中，这种更普遍的现象被称为**污染效应**。<sup>2</sup>

早期对启发式与偏差的研究发现了锚定效应，例如：当受试者被先问“非洲在联合国中占的国家比例是否高于或低于 10（或 65）%”时，他们给出的估计值更低（或更高）。这种效应最初被解释为：受试者从锚点开始调整，直到达到一个看起来合理的值，但**调整不足**，因为他们在达到可信区间的边缘时就停止了。<sup>3</sup>

Tversky 和 Kahneman 的早期假设在某些情况下仍然是正确的，特别是当受试者**自己生成初始估计值**时。但现代研究显示，大多数锚定效应实际上是由于**污染效应**而不是**滑动调整**造成的。<sup>4</sup>

你逛超市时可能会看到写着“每人限购 12 件”或“5 件只需 \$10”的烦人标志。这些标志真能促使顾客多买点吗？你可能[以为自己不会受影响](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_blind_spot)。但肯定有人受影响，因为这些标志**确实有效**。这就是为什么超市会一直用这些策略。<sup>5</sup>

但污染效应最令人畏惧的地方在于，它是**确认偏误（confirmation bias）**千张面孔中的又一张。<sup>6</sup> 一旦一个想法进入你的脑海，它就会启动与你相兼容的信息——从而**保证了它的持续存在**。别管赢得政治辩论的选择压力了；**确认偏误直接植根于我们的硬件结构中**，我们的联想网络会启动那些兼容的思想和记忆。这是我们作为神经生物体所付出的代价。

**一个短暂的画面就足以激活与之关联的词语识别**。不要以为需要更多的东西才能启动确认偏误。**只需要一个短暂的闪现，你心中的结论就已经被决定了**，因为我们改变主意的频率**远没有我们想象得那么高**……

## Priming and Contamination

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Suppose you ask subjects to press one button if a string of letters forms a word, and another button if the string does not form a word (e.g., “banack” vs. “banner”). Then you show them the string “water.” Later, they will more quickly identify the string “drink” as a word. This is known as “cognitive priming”; this particular form would be “semantic priming” or “conceptual priming.”

The fascinating thing about priming is that it occurs at such a low level—priming speeds up identifying letters as forming a word, which one would expect to take place before you deliberate on the word’s meaning.

Priming also reveals the massive parallelism of spreading activation: if seeing “water” activates the word “drink,” it probably also activates “river,” or “cup,” or “splash” . . . and this activation spreads, from the semantic linkage of concepts, all the way back to recognizing strings of letters.

Priming is subconscious and unstoppable, an artifact of the human neural architecture. Trying to stop yourself from priming is like trying to stop the spreading activation of your own neural circuits.

Try making a set of index cards with words like Brown written in randomly assigned colors–a red Green, a blue Yellow, and so on. Try to say aloud the color—not the meaning, but the color—of the letter-strings.

In Mussweiler and Strack’s experiment, subjects were asked an anchoring question: “Is the annual mean temperature in Germany higher or lower than 5°C / 20°C?”<sup>1</sup> Afterward, on a word-identification task, subjects presented with the 5°C anchor were faster on identifying words like “cold” and “snow,” while subjects with the high anchor were faster to identify “hot” and “sun.” This shows a non-adjustment mechanism for anchoring: priming compatible thoughts and memories.

The more general result is that completely uninformative, known false, or totally irrelevant “information” can influence estimates and decisions. In the field of heuristics and biases, this more general phenomenon is known as contamination.<sup>2</sup>

Early research in heuristics and biases discovered anchoring effects, such as subjects giving lower (higher) estimates of the percentage of UN countries found within Africa, depending on whether they were first asked if the percentage was more or less than 10 (65). This effect was originally attributed to subjects adjusting from the anchor as a starting point, stopping as soon as they reached a plausible value, and under-adjusting because they were stopping at one end of a confidence interval.<sup>3</sup>

Tversky and Kahneman’s early hypothesis still appears to be the correct explanation in some circumstances, notably when subjects generate the initial estimate themselves. But modern research seems to show that most anchoring is actually due to contamination, not sliding adjustment.<sup>4</sup>

Your grocery store probably has annoying signs saying “Limit 12 per customer” or “5 for \$10.” Are these signs effective at getting customers to buy in larger quantities? You probably [think you’re not influenced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_blind_spot). But someone must be, because these signs have been shown to work. Which is why stores keep putting them up.<sup>5</sup>

Yet the most fearsome aspect of contamination is that it serves as yet another of the thousand faces of confirmation bias.6 Once an idea gets into your head, it primes information compatible with it—and thereby ensures its continued existence. Never mind the selection pressures for winning political arguments; confirmation bias is built directly into our hardware, associational networks priming compatible thoughts and memories. An unfortunate side effect of our existence as neural creatures.

A single fleeting image can be enough to prime associated words for recognition. Don’t think it takes anything more to set confirmation bias in motion. All it takes is that one quick flash, and the bottom line is already decided, for we change our minds less often than we think . . .
