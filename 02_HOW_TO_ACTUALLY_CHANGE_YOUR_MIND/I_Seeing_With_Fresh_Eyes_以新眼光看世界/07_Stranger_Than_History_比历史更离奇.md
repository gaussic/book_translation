## 比历史更离奇

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

假设我告诉你，以下这些说法都确凿无疑地是真的：

* 如果你把自己涂成一种介于蓝色和绿色之间的精确颜色，重力对你就会反转，你会向上坠落。
* 在未来，天空中将布满数十亿个漂浮的黑色球体。每一个球体都比人类历史上所有齐柏林飞艇加起来还要大。如果你给这个球体一些钱，它就会从天上用蹦极绳放下一个男妓。
* 你的孙辈们会认为，把小偷关进监狱不仅是愚蠢的，还是邪恶的；他们认为应该打屁股而不是坐牢。

你会觉得我疯了，对吧？

那么我们把时间倒回到1901年，假设你必须在相信我刚刚讲的那些话和以下这些话之间做出选择：

* 存在一个绝对的速度上限，两个物体之间相对运动的最大速度正好是每小时670,616,629.2英里。如果你坐上一辆几乎以这个速度行驶的火车，再从窗户里开枪，长度的基本单位会发生变化，所以在你看来子弹还是往前飞，但别人看到的却完全不同。哦，对了，时间也会改变。
* 将来会出现一个由数十亿台计算器组成的超级互联全球网络，每一台的计算能力都超过1901年之前所有计算器的总和。这个网络的主要用途之一将是通过把色情影像伪装成数字的形式，来传播女同性恋色情视频。
* 你的孙辈们会认为，说某人不应该成为美国总统只是因为她是黑人，这不仅愚蠢，而且邪恶。

这篇文章的灵感来源于 Robin Hanson 的一条评论：“我想知道，是否可以用足够详细的方式描述一个虚构的另类现实故事，让我们的祖先无法分辨那是真实还是虚构，从而清楚地看出现实有多么令人震惊。”<sup>1</sup>

## Stranger than History

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Suppose I told you that I knew for a fact that the following statements were true:

- If you paint yourself a certain exact color between blue and green, it will reverse the force of gravity on you and cause you to fall upward.
- In the future, the sky will be filled by billions of floating black spheres. Each sphere will be larger than all the zeppelins that have ever existed put together. If you offer a sphere money, it will lower a male prostitute out of the sky on a bungee cord.
- Your grandchildren will think it is not just foolish, but evil, to put thieves in jail instead of spanking them.

You’d think I was crazy, right?

Now suppose it were the year 1901, and you had to choose between believing those statements I have just offered, and believing statements like the following:

- There is an absolute speed limit on how fast two objects can seem to be traveling relative to each other, which is exactly 670,616,629.2 miles per hour. If you hop on board a train going almost this fast and fire a gun out the window, the fundamental units of length change around, so it looks to you like the bullet is speeding ahead of you, but other people see something different. Oh, and time changes around too.
- In the future, there will be a superconnected global network of billions of adding machines, each one of which has more power than all pre-1901 adding machines put together. One of the primary uses of this network will be to transport moving pictures of lesbian sex by pretending they are made out of numbers.
- Your grandchildren will think it is not just foolish, but evil, to say that someone should not be President of the United States because she is black.

Based on a comment of Robin Hanson’s: “I wonder if one could describe in enough detail a fictional story of an alternative reality, a reality that our ancestors could not distinguish from the truth, in order to make it very clear how surprising the truth turned out to be.”<sup>1</sup>
