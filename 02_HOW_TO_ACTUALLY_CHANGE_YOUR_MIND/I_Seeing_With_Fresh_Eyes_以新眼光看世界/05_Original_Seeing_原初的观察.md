## 原初的观察

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

既然罗伯特·波西格（Robert Pirsig）已经把这件事表达得非常好，我就直接引用他的话。我不知道这个故事是否真实发生过，但无论真假，它都是**真的**。

> 他一直在为学生们写不出东西而苦恼。起初他以为这是懒惰，但后来显然不是。他们只是想不出任何可写的内容。
>
> 其中有个戴着厚镜片眼镜的女孩，想写一篇关于“美国”的五百字作文。他早就习惯了听到这种话时那种心里一沉的感觉，于是毫不贬低地建议她把主题缩小到“博兹曼”。
>
> 作文交的日子到了，她没有交稿，而且情绪很低落。她一再尝试，但就是写不出来。
>
> 他一下子也不知道该说什么了。沉默了一会儿，然后他灵机一动，说道：“那就再缩小一点，只写博兹曼的主街。”这是一道灵光。
>
> 她顺从地点点头出去了。但就在下节课前，她带着真正的痛苦回来了，这次是流着泪的痛苦，显然已经压抑了很久。她还是想不出该写什么，她不明白，既然她对整个博兹曼都写不出什么，为什么对一条街就能写出什么来。
>
> 他很生气：“你根本没有**看**！”他说。他突然想起自己因为话太多而被大学开除的那段经历。对每一个事实，都有无数个假设。你看得越多，就会看到越多。而她确实没有认真去看，却也完全无法理解这一点。
>
> 他气愤地对她说：“把范围缩小到博兹曼主街上一栋建筑的正面——歌剧院。就从左上角的那块砖开始写。”
>
> 她那厚厚镜片后面的眼睛睁大了。
>
> 下一节课她带着一脸疑惑走进教室，递给他一篇五千字的作文，内容是关于蒙大拿州博兹曼主街上歌剧院的正面。“我坐在对面的汉堡店里，”她说，“开始写第一块砖，然后是第二块，然后到了第三块，一切就突然涌现出来了，我根本停不下来。他们都觉得我疯了，还一直拿我打趣，但我全写出来了。我不明白是怎么回事。”
>
> 他也不明白。但在之后一次次漫步于城中的街道上时，他反复思索这件事，最终得出结论：她明显被某种阻碍卡住了，就像他第一天教书时那种瘫痪状态。她被困住，是因为她试图在写作中重复自己已经听说过的内容，就像他第一天试图重复自己已经准备好的讲稿。她之所以不知道该写些什么关于博兹曼的，是因为她回忆不出有什么“值得重复”的东西。她奇怪地没有意识到，自己其实可以靠着**当下的观察**，靠自己亲眼所见，去写一些原始的、真实的东西，而不需要从“别人说过什么”开始思考。她被要求只写“一块砖”时，这个障碍突然瓦解了——因为她必须开始**真正地、亲自地去观察**。

## Original Seeing

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Since Robert Pirsig put this very well, I’ll just copy down what he said. I don’t know if this story is based on reality or not, but either way, it’s true.

> He’d been having trouble with students who had nothing to say. At first he thought it was laziness but later it became apparent that it wasn’t. They just couldn’t think of anything to say.
> 
> One of them, a girl with strong-lensed glasses, wanted to write a five-hundred word essay about the United States. He was used to the sinking feeling that comes from statements like this, and suggested without disparagement that she narrow it down to just Bozeman.
> 
> When the paper came due she didn’t have it and was quite upset. She had tried and tried but she just couldn’t think of anything to say.
> 
> It just stumped him. Now he couldn’t think of anything to say. A silence occurred, and then a peculiar answer: “Narrow it down to the main street of Bozeman.” It was a stroke of insight.
> 
> She nodded dutifully and went out. But just before her next class she came back in real distress, tears this time, distress that had obviously been there for a long time. She still couldn’t think of anything to say, and couldn’t understand why, if she couldn’t think of anything about all of Bozeman, she should be able to think of something about just one street.
> 
> He was furious. “You’re not looking!” he said. A memory came back of his own dismissal from the University for having too much to say. For every fact there is an infinity of hypotheses. The more you look the more you see. She really wasn’t looking and yet somehow didn’t understand this.
> 
> He told her angrily, “Narrow it down to the front of one building on the main street of Bozeman. The Opera House. Start with the upper left-hand brick.”
> 
> Her eyes, behind the thick-lensed glasses, opened wide.
> 
> She came in the next class with a puzzled look and handed him a five-thousand-word essay on the front of the Opera House on the main street of Bozeman, Montana. “I sat in the hamburger stand across the street,” she said, “and started writing about the first brick, and the second brick, and then by the third brick it all started to come and I couldn’t stop. They thought I was crazy, and they kept kidding me, but here it all is. I don’t understand it.”
> 
> Neither did he, but on long walks through the streets of town he thought about it and concluded she was evidently stopped with the same kind of blockage that had paralyzed him on his first day of teaching. She was blocked because she was trying to repeat, in her writing, things she had already heard, just as on the first day he had tried to repeat things he had already decided to say. She couldn’t think of anything to write about Bozeman because she couldn’t recall anything she had heard worth repeating. She was strangely unaware that she could look and see freshly for herself, as she wrote, without primary regard for what had been said before. The narrowing down to one brick destroyed the blockage because it was so obvious she had to do some original and direct seeing.
