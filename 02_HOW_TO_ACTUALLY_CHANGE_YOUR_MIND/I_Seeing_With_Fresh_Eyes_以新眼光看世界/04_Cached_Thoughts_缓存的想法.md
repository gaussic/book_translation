## 缓存的想法

*作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky*

人脑最令人费解的问题之一就是：这玩意儿到底是怎么工作的？大多数神经元每秒只发射 10–20 次，最多也不过 200Hz。在神经科学中有个“百步规则”：任何假设的认知操作最多只能包含 100 个连续步骤——你可以用多线程并行处理，但串行的神经脉冲不能超过 100（最好更少）。

想象一下要用 100Hz 的 CPU 编程，不管你有多少块芯片？你可能得用上一千亿个处理器，才能实现实时运算。

如果你真的需要为一千亿个 100Hz 的处理器写实时程序，有一个技巧你一定会用到极致——**缓存**。也就是把过去的计算结果存起来，以后直接调用，不必重新计算。这在神经系统中也是一种典型的处理方式——识别、联想、模式补全。

一个合理的猜测是：人类认知的大部分，其实就是在查缓存。

这个想法在某些时刻常常浮现在我脑海中。

我曾经看到一个非常有趣的例子（本来以为自己收藏了，但怎么都找不到了）：有个男人的邻居曾不经意地说起，拆除烟囱最好的方法是：先把壁炉敲掉，让砖头自己掉下一层，再敲那一层的砖头，如此反复，直到整个烟囱拆完。几年后，这个男人真的打算拆掉自家的烟囱，那段**缓存的想法**就跳出来了……

后来他回忆说——你也能猜到这事没什么好结果——那位邻居并不是什么权威，也不怎么懂这些事。如果他当时质疑一下这个主意，也许就会意识到它根本靠不住。有些“命中缓存”的内容，我们其实应该重新算一遍。但大脑总是自动地完成模式补全——如果你没意识到这个模式需要修正，就会默认它是对的。

我怀疑，如果这个想法是他自己独立想出来的——如果他自己灵光一闪想到这个拆烟囱的方法——他可能会更加仔细地审视一下。但如果一个想法已经被别人想过了，你就可以省点脑力，直接调用他们的结论——对吧？

尤其是在现代文明中，没有人能快到自己从头思考所有事。如果我从小被扔进森林，由狼或者不会说话的机器人养大，我可能根本不能被称作“人类”。没有人能在一生中，从零开始重建一个狩猎采集部落的智慧。至于一个有文字的文明的智慧？那根本就别想了。

但这也有反面：我不断看到自认为在进行批判性思考的人，复述的却是根本不是由批判性思维者发明出来的**缓存想法**。

比如，“怀疑论者”常会让步说：“你不能用事实来证明或证伪宗教。”可我在别处已经指出过，[这在概率论中完全是错的](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality/religion-s-claim-to-be-non-disprovable)。它在宗教心理学上也是错的——几个世纪前，说出这种话会让你被火刑处死。一个母亲为患癌的女儿祈祷：“上帝啊，请治好我女儿”，她可不会祷告说：“亲爱的上帝，我知道宗教不允许有可证伪的结果，所以你不可能治好我女儿……所以我其实只是为了安慰自己，而不是为了真正帮到她。”

但人们读到“你不能用事实证伪宗教”这句话后，下次看到能证伪宗教的证据时，他们的大脑会自动完成那个模式。甚至有些无神论者也毫不迟疑地重复这种荒谬。如果这个想法是他们自己独立思考得出的，也许他们会更加怀疑。

死亡。补全这个模式：“死亡赋予生命意义。”

你和那些善良正直的人谈论生存风险时会感到沮丧——这些人一辈子都不会自发地想去毁灭人类，却会在这个话题上说：“也许人类就不配活着。”他们绝不会向自己孩子开枪，而那个孩子也是人类的一部分，但大脑仍然会自动完成这个模式。

在你脑中，正在被补全的那些模式，有多少是你根本没选择过的？

理性。补全这个模式：“爱是不理性的。”

如果这个想法是你突然独立产生的、全新的思想，你会如何批判地审视它？我知道我会[这么说](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality/feeling-rational)，但你呢？用全新的视角来看问题很难。试着阻止你的大脑，用标准、老套、熟悉的方式补全答案。也许最终答案还是老答案，但你得先阻止大脑自动填空，才能真正思考。

现在你读完了这篇文章，下次当你听到有人毫不犹豫地重复一个你觉得可笑或错误的“观点”时，你就会想：“缓存的想法。”我的观点现在也在你脑中，等待着被补全成某种模式。但它是真的吗？别让大脑自动完成这个模式！**想一想！**

## Cached Thoughts

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

One of the single greatest puzzles about the human brain is how the damn thing works at all when most neurons fire 10–20 times per second, or 200Hz tops. In neurology, the “hundred-step rule” is that any postulated operation has to complete in at most 100 sequential steps—you can be as parallel as you like, but you can’t postulate more than 100 (preferably fewer) neural spikes one after the other.

Can you imagine having to program using 100Hz CPUs, no matter how many of them you had? You’d also need a hundred billion processors just to get anything done in realtime.

If you did need to write realtime programs for a hundred billion 100Hz processors, one trick you’d use as heavily as possible is caching. That’s when you store the results of previous operations and look them up next time, instead of recomputing them from scratch. And it’s a very neural idiom—recognition, association, completing the pattern.

It’s a good guess that the actual majority of human cognition consists of cache lookups.

This thought does tend to go through my mind at certain times.

There was a wonderfully illustrative story which I thought I had bookmarked, but couldn’t re-find: it was the story of a man whose know-it-all neighbor had once claimed in passing that the best way to remove a chimney from your house was to knock out the fireplace, wait for the bricks to drop down one level, knock out those bricks, and repeat until the chimney was gone. Years later, when the man wanted to remove his own chimney, this cached thought was lurking, waiting to pounce . . .

As the man noted afterward—you can guess it didn’t go well—his neighbor was not particularly knowledgeable in these matters, not a trusted source. If he’d questioned the idea, he probably would have realized it was a poor one. Some cache hits we’d be better off recomputing. But the brain completes the pattern automatically—and if you don’t consciously realize the pattern needs correction, you’ll be left with a completed pattern.

I suspect that if the thought had occurred to the man himself—if he’d personally had this bright idea for how to remove a chimney—he would have examined the idea more critically. But if someone else has already thought an idea through, you can save on computing power by caching their conclusion—right?

In modern civilization particularly, no one can think fast enough to think their own thoughts. If I’d been abandoned in the woods as an infant, raised by wolves or silent robots, I would scarcely be recognizable as human. No one can think fast enough to recapitulate the wisdom of a hunter-gatherer tribe in one lifetime, starting from scratch. As for the wisdom of a literate civilization, forget it.

But the flip side of this is that I continually see people who aspire to critical thinking, repeating back cached thoughts which were not invented by critical thinkers.

A good example is the skeptic who concedes, “Well, you can’t prove or disprove a religion by factual evidence.” As I have pointed out elsewhere,<sup>1</sup> this is simply false as probability theory. And it is also simply false relative to the real psychology of religion—a few centuries ago, saying this would have gotten you burned at the stake. A mother whose daughter has cancer prays, “God, please heal my daughter,” not, “Dear God, I know that religions are not allowed to have any falsifiable consequences, which means that you can’t possibly heal my daughter, so . . . well, basically, I’m praying to make myself feel better, instead of doing something that could actually help my daughter.”

But people read “You can’t prove or disprove a religion by factual evidence,” and then, the next time they see a piece of evidence disproving a religion, their brain completes the pattern. Even some atheists repeat this absurdity without hesitation. If they’d thought of the idea themselves, rather than hearing it from someone else, they would have been more skeptical.

Death. Complete the pattern: “Death gives meaning to life.”

It’s frustrating, talking to good and decent folk—people who would never in a thousand years spontaneously think of wiping out the human species—raising the topic of existential risk, and hearing them say, “Well, maybe the human species doesn’t deserve to survive.” They would never in a thousand years shoot their own child, who is a part of the human species, but the brain completes the pattern.

What patterns are being completed, inside your mind, that you never chose to be there?

Rationality. Complete the pattern: “Love isn’t rational.”

If this idea had suddenly occurred to you personally, as an entirely new thought, how would you examine it critically? I know what I would [say](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality/feeling-rational), but what would you? It can be hard to see with fresh eyes. Try to keep your mind from completing the pattern in the standard, unsurprising, already-known way. It may be that there is no better answer than the standard one, but you can’t think about the answer until you can stop your brain from filling in the answer automatically.

Now that you’ve read this, the next time you hear someone unhesitatingly repeating a meme you think is silly or false, you’ll think, “Cached thoughts.” My belief is now there in your mind, waiting to complete the pattern. But is it true? Don’t let your mind complete the pattern! Think!
