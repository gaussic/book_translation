## 狭隘的美德

在各自的专业领域中，人们能很好地理解“狭隘”的重要性；一名汽车修理工知道化油器和散热器的区别，他不会把它们一概称作“汽车零件”。一名狩猎采集者知道狮子和美洲豹的不同。一名清洁工不会用玻璃清洁剂擦地板——即使这些瓶子在外行人眼中长得很像。

但在非专业领域中，人们常常犯下“泛化”这个错误：试图把一个词的涵盖范围尽可能扩大，恨不得包罗万象。谈论全世界的苹果，难道不是更光辉、更智慧、更令人印象深刻吗？解释“人类思维”的整体，不被诸如“人类是如何发明解魔方的技巧”这类琐碎问题所干扰，难道不是更高尚的目标？事实上，这些具体问题似乎根本就不值得考虑；毕竟，一个“通用理论”本身就已经足够值得称道，不是吗？

但好奇者的做法却是：从千千万万个海滩卵石中捡起一颗，仔细观察，发现它有些新奇、有趣、不同寻常的地方。你将这些特别的卵石称为“钻石”，并追问它们有什么特别之处——它们是否在某些内在特质上彼此相通，而不只是你最初注意到的闪光之处。接着，就有人走过来，说：“为什么不把这颗卵石也叫钻石？还有这颗，还有这颗呢？”他们满怀热情，出于好意。毕竟，把某些卵石称为“钻石”而其他的不是，似乎很不民主、不包容、有精英主义气息，也不够整体性。似乎……思想太狭隘了……请原谅我用了这个词。这样的态度看起来既不开放，也不包容，更不合群。

你也许会觉得，把一个词赋予多重含义是一种诗意的行为，从而营造出丰富的联想。但即使是诗人——只要他们是优秀的诗人——也必须学会准确地观察世界。仅仅把爱情比作一朵花是不够的。炽热的、妒忌的、未竟的爱，与一对携手几十年的夫妻之爱，是截然不同的。如果你想用一朵花来象征妒忌之爱，你必须走进花园，仔细分辨——找到一种香气浓烈、颜色鲜艳、带刺的花朵。即便你的目的是营造联想和语义层次，也必须准确追踪你所赋予的具体意义和情感色彩。

无论是理性思维的艺术，还是诗歌的艺术，都离不开专注于那些拥有特殊性质、与众不同的卵石。去仔细观察那些卵石——**唯独那些卵石！**——之间共同的特征。这并不是一种罪过。

现代进化生物学家专注于解释生物的演化模式，而不是恒星的“演化”或科技的“演化”，这完全没问题。不幸的是，有些人却用“演化”一词同时指代复制生命在自然选择下形成的模式、恒星结构的偶然演化、以及科技结构中的智能配置。众所周知，只要使用同一个词，那必定就是同一种事物。这些生物学家大概只是太笨，才没发现其中的联系吧。

而且，还有什么比“看到联系”更有美德呢？毫无疑问，最有智慧的人类就是那些新时代心灵导师了，他们说：“一切都彼此相连。”如果你说出这句话，请停顿一下，好让大家有时间领会这番深邃智慧所带来的震撼。

图论中，图与其补图之间存在一种平庸的映射关系：一个完全连通的图（每两个节点之间都有边）所传达的信息量，与一个完全无边的图其实一样。**真正重要的图，是那些有些节点之间没有连接的图。**

当那些未开化的人试图说一些“深奥”的话时，他们会没完没了地把这个话题和那个话题类比，然后再和另一个相似的东西联系起来，如此类推——直到他们的图完全连通，也完全无用。解决方案是：**具体知识与深入研究。** 当你对某事有了细致的理解，你就能看出哪些地方不相同，然后兴奋地从你的图中减去那些不该存在的边。

同样地，**真正重要的分类，是那些不包含宇宙中一切事物的分类。** 好的假设只能解释某些可能结果，而不能解释全部。

当年牛顿只解释了**重力**——只是解释了物体如何下落、行星如何围绕太阳运转、月亮如何引发潮汐，而没有解释金钱在社会中的作用或心脏如何泵血，这完全没问题。讥讽“狭隘”的态度，让人想起古希腊人：他们认为出去观察事物是体力劳动，而体力劳动是奴隶干的事。

就像柏拉图在《理想国》第七卷中写道：

> 如果有人仰着头，透过凝视天花板上的图案而学到点什么，你显然会认为他是用理性在思考，其实他只是用眼睛在盯着看……我只能相信，唯有那些研究真正存在之物与不可见之物的学科，才能让灵魂仰望高处。无论一个人仰望天空还是垂头凝视，只要他关注的是感官之物，我就断言他学不到真知；因为这些东西不允许真正的知识诞生：我说，他的灵魂是在向下看，而不是向上看——即便他是仰躺在陆地或海上漂浮。

今天，许多人犯下了类似的错误，认为“狭义概念”就像是走出去亲眼观察世界那样低贱、不高尚、不够哲学——这种行为似乎只配属于下层阶级。但理性主义者——甚至诗人——都需要**狭窄的词汇**来表达**精准的思想**；他们需要那些**只包含一部分事物、排除其他事物**的分类。专注思想、缩小类别、排除不适项、精炼命题，这些都**没有错！** 如果你把词语用得过于宽泛，最终得到的东西，既不真实，也成不了好诗。

*至于那些把 Wikipedia 称为“人工智能”、把 LSD 的发明叫做“奇点”、或把公司说成是“超级智能”的人……我都懒得吐槽了！*

## The Virtue of Narrowness

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

> What is true of one apple may not be true of another apple; thus more can be said about a single apple than about all the apples in the world.
> 
> —“The Twelve Virtues of Rationality”

Within their own professions, people grasp the importance of narrowness; a car mechanic knows the difference between a carburetor and a radiator, and would not think of them both as “car parts.” A hunter-gatherer knows the difference between a lion and a panther. A janitor does not wipe the floor with window cleaner, even if the bottles look similar to one who has not mastered the art.

Outside their own professions, people often commit the misstep of trying to broaden a word as widely as possible, to cover as much territory as possible. Is it not more glorious, more wise, more impressive, to talk about all the apples in the world? How much loftier it must be to explain human thought in general, without being distracted by smaller questions, such as how humans invent techniques for solving a Rubik’s Cube. Indeed, it scarcely seems necessary to consider specific questions at all; isn’t a general theory a worthy enough accomplishment on its own?

It is the way of the curious to lift up one pebble from among a million pebbles on the shore, and see something new about it, something interesting, something different. You call these pebbles “diamonds,” and ask what might be special about them—what inner qualities they might have in common, beyond the glitter you first noticed. And then someone else comes along and says: “Why not call this pebble a diamond too? And this one, and this one?” They are enthusiastic, and they mean well. For it seems undemocratic and exclusionary and elitist and unholistic to call some pebbles “diamonds,” and others not. It seems . . . narrow-minded . . . if you’ll pardon the phrase. Hardly open, hardly embracing, hardly communal.

You might think it poetic, to give one word many meanings, and thereby spread shades of connotation all around. But even poets, if they are good poets, must learn to see the world precisely. It is not enough to compare love to a flower. Hot jealous unconsummated love is not the same as the love of a couple married for decades. If you need a flower to symbolize jealous love, you must go into the garden, and look, and make subtle distinctions—find a flower with a heady scent, and a bright color, and thorns. Even if your intent is to shade meanings and cast connotations, you must keep precise track of exactly which meanings you shade and connote.

It is a necessary part of the rationalist’s art—or even the poet’s art!—to focus narrowly on unusual pebbles which possess some special quality. And look at the details which those pebbles—and those pebbles alone!—share among each other. This is not a sin.

It is perfectly all right for modern evolutionary biologists to explain just the patterns of living creatures, and not the “evolution” of stars or the “evolution” of technology. Alas, some unfortunate souls use the same word “evolution” to cover the naturally selected patterns of replicating life, and the strictly accidental structure of stars, and the intelligently configured structure of technology. And as we all know, if people use the same word, it must all be the same thing. These biologists must just be too dumb to see the connections.

And what could be more virtuous than seeing connections? Surely the wisest of all human beings are the New Age gurus who say, “Everything is connected to everything else.” If you ever say this aloud, you should pause, so that everyone can absorb the sheer shock of this Deep Wisdom.

There is a trivial mapping between a graph and its complement. A fully connected graph, with an edge between every two vertices, conveys the same amount of information as a graph with no edges at all. The important graphs are the ones where some things are not connected to some other things.

When the unenlightened ones try to be profound, they draw endless verbal comparisons between this topic, and that topic, which is like this, which is like that; until their graph is fully connected and also totally useless. The remedy is specific knowledge and in-depth study. When you understand things in detail, you can see how they are not alike, and start enthusiastically subtracting edges off your graph.

Likewise, the important categories are the ones that do not contain everything in the universe. Good hypotheses can only explain some possible outcomes, and not others.

It was perfectly all right for Isaac Newton to explain just gravity, just the way things fall down—and how planets orbit the Sun, and how the Moon generates the tides—but not the role of money in human society or how the heart pumps blood. Sneering at narrowness is rather reminiscent of ancient Greeks who thought that going out and actually looking at things was manual labor, and manual labor was for slaves.

As Plato put it in The Republic, Book VII:

> If anyone should throw back his head and learn something by staring at the varied patterns on a ceiling, apparently you would think that he was contemplating with his reason, when he was only staring with his eyes . . . I cannot but believe that no study makes the soul look on high except that which is concerned with real being and the unseen. Whether he gape and stare upwards, or shut his mouth and stare downwards, if it be things of the senses that he tries to learn something about, I declare he never could learn, for none of these things admit of knowledge: I say his soul is looking down, not up, even if he is floating on his back on land or on sea!

Many today make a similar mistake, and think that narrow concepts are as lowly and unlofty and unphilosophical as, say, going out and looking at things—an endeavor only suited to the underclass. But rationalists—and also poets—need narrow words to express precise thoughts; they need categories that include only some things, and exclude others. There’s nothing wrong with focusing your mind, narrowing your categories, excluding possibilities, and sharpening your propositions. Really, there isn’t! If you make your words too broad, you end up with something that isn’t true and doesn’t even make good poetry.
