## 我们改变主意的次数比我们想的少

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

> 在过去的几年里，我们曾悄悄地接触到一些面临工作选择的同事，要求他们估计自己选择某个工作而非另一个的概率。预测的选择信心平均为66%，但在24名受访者中，只有1人选择了自己最初赋予较低概率的选项，整体准确率为96%。

当我第一次读到以上文字——2003年8月1日下午3点左右——它改变了我思考问题的方式。我意识到，一旦我能猜出自己的答案是什么——一旦我能给某个选择赋予比另一个更高的概率——那么，我很可能已经做出了决定。我们改变主意的频率远低于我们想象的。大多数时候，我们在听到问题的半秒钟内就能猜到自己的答案。

那个我们尚未能够猜出答案的瞬间，是如此迅速而不易察觉；那是一个可以让智慧介入的微小时机。在选择问题中，正如在事实问题中一样。

底线原则是，只有你信念的实际原因才能决定你作为一个理性主义者的有效性。一旦你的信念固定了，任何争论都无法改变它的真实性；一旦你的决定固定了，任何争论都无法改变其后果。

你可能认为，你能够通过非理性手段得出一个信念或决定，然后尝试为它辩解，如果发现无法辩解，就放弃它。

但是，我们改变主意的次数远比我们想象的少——要少得多。

我相信你至少能想到一生中曾改变过一次主意的情况。我们每个人都能想到。那么，生活中那些你没有改变主意的情况呢？它们是否也同样鲜明，容易在你评估自己能力时被提取出来？

在事后偏差、虚假因果关系、积极偏差、锚定/启动效应等等，再加上最可怕的确认偏差，一旦一个想法进入你的脑海，它可能就会停留在那里。

## We Change Our Minds Less Often Than We Think

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

> Over the past few years, we have discreetly approached colleagues faced with a choice between job offers, and asked them to estimate the probability that they will choose one job over another. The average confidence in the predicted choice was a modest 66%, but only 1 of the 24 respondents chose the option to which he or she initially assigned a lower probability, yielding an overall accuracy rate of 96%.

When I first read the words above—on August 1st, 2003, at around 3 o’clock in the afternoon—it changed the way I thought. I realized that once I could guess what my answer would be—once I could assign a higher probability to deciding one way than other—then I had, in all probability, already decided. We change our minds less often than we think. And most of the time we become able to guess what our answer will be within half a second of hearing the question.

How swiftly that unnoticed moment passes, when we can’t yet guess what our answer will be; the tiny window of opportunity for intelligence to act. In questions of choice, as in questions of fact.

The principle of the bottom line is that only the actual causes of your beliefs determine your effectiveness as a rationalist. Once your belief is fixed, no amount of argument will alter the truth-value; once your decision is fixed, no amount of argument will alter the consequences.

You might think that you could arrive at a belief, or a decision, by non-rational means, and then try to justify it, and if you found you couldn’t justify it, reject it.

But we change our minds less often—much less often—than we think.

I’m sure that you can think of at least one occasion in your life when you’ve changed your mind. We all can. How about all the occasions in your life when you didn’t change your mind? Are they as available, in your heuristic estimate of your competence?

Between hindsight bias, fake causality, positive bias, anchoring/priming, et cetera, et cetera, and above all the dreaded confirmation bias, once an idea gets into your head, it’s probably going to stay there.
