## 不要相信你能成功自欺

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

我无意针对 Kurige，但如果你在 Less Wrong 上发言时说出以下内容，我想你得预料到会有人提出质疑：

> 我逐渐意识到，一件能解释我与大多数其他基督徒交谈时所感受到的差异的事情，是我的世界观在某个时刻发生了重大转变，从盲目信仰转向了某种接近奥威尔式**双重思想**的东西。

“如果你知道那是[双重思想](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/doublethink-cho.html)...

...你怎么还能相信它呢？”我忍不住想这样问。

[或者](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/#u3)：

> 我选择去相信上帝的存在——是有意识地、刻意地。这一决定，然而，对上帝是否真的存在，**完全没有任何影响**。

如果你知道自己的信念和现实无关，那你怎么还能相信它呢？

难道不会有一种直觉上的顿悟：“哦，等等，天空真的不是绿色的”，这应该是你意识到“我的地图上写着‘天空是绿色的’，但这根本没有理由与现实对应”之后自然产生的吗？

唔……显然不是。

这个谜题的一部分，或许可以用我对[摩尔悖论](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/)（“在下雨，但我不相信在下雨”）的解释来说明——人们在内省时，往往会把附着在一句引述信念上的积极情感，误以为是真正的信仰。

但还有另一部分原因可能是——与我最初想要表达的那种愤慨相反——从“反映现实的地图应该说‘X’”跳跃到“我真的相信‘X’”，其实**并不容易**。理解[心智是一种地图与领地之间的对应构建器](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/what-is-evidenc.html)这个理念需要一定的努力，而要在直觉层面上领会其含义，可能还需要更多功夫。

我现在意识到，当我[写下](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/)“你不能通过意志的力量让自己相信天空是绿色的”时，我不仅仅是在冷静陈述一个事实。**我还在尝试植入一个自我实现的预言**。

或许，有意识地重复以下说法是明智的做法：

**“我无法逃避双重思想！我内心深处知道那不是真的！如果我知道我的地图和现实没有任何合理的关联，那就意味着我根本不相信它！”**

因为这样的话——当你哪天真的动了“自欺”的念头时，那些想法“但我知道这不是真的！”和“我骗不了自己！”就会自然浮现于脑海；而这样，你就**确实更不容易骗过自己**。你更有可能在直觉上明白：告诉自己 X 并不会让 X 成为事实：因此，X 就**真的不成立**。

如果你不断告诉自己，**你无法仅凭意愿让自己相信天空是绿色的**——那么你在某种层面上骗自己（无论是真信，还是陷入[摩尔悖论](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/)、[信仰信仰](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/belief-in-belie.html)，或是[相信自欺](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/s/belief_in_selfdeception/)）的可能性就会降低。

如果你不断告诉自己，你内心深处会知道——

如果你不断告诉自己，你会看着那张精心构造的虚假地图，然后**意识到它是虚假的，没有任何与现实一致的预期关联**，因此，尽管它构造得再复杂，你也无法真正投入信任——

如果你不断告诉自己，一旦你在元层面意识到“这张地图不再反映现实”，你的**反思一致性**就会接管，从而让你在对象层面上停止相信——

那么，在关键时刻——你**或许真的会失败于自欺**。

在面对**有意的自欺**时，你必须**相信自己的“无法成功”**！

**告诉自己：这场努力注定失败——于是它真的就会失败！**

这到底是积极思维的力量，还是消极思维的力量？无论如何，这似乎都是一种明智的防范手段。

## Don't Believe You'll Self-Deceive

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

I don't mean to seem like I'm picking on Kurige, but I think you have to expect a certain amount of questioning if you show up on Less Wrong and say:

> One thing I've come to realize that helps to explain the disparity I feel when I talk with most other Christians is the fact that somewhere along the way my world-view took a major shift away from blind faith and landed somewhere in the vicinity of Orwellian double-think.

"If you know it's [double-think](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/doublethink-cho.html)...

...how can you still believe it?" I helplessly want to say.

[Or](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/#u3):

> I chose to believe in the existence of God—deliberately and consciously. This decision, however, has absolutely zero effect on the actual existence of God.

If you know your belief isn't correlated to reality, how can you still believe it?

Shouldn't the gut-level realization, "Oh, wait, the sky really isn't green" follow from the realization "My map that says 'the sky is green' has no reason to be correlated with the territory"?

Well... apparently not.

One part of this puzzle may be my explanation of [Moore's Paradox](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/) ("It's raining, but I don't believe it is")—that people introspectively mistake positive affect attached to a quoted belief, for actual credulity.

But another part of it may just be that—contrary to the indignation I initially wanted to put forward—it's actually quite easy not to make the jump from "The map that reflects the territory would say 'X'" to actually believing "X".  It takes some work to explain the ideas of [minds as map-territory correspondence builders](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/what-is-evidenc.html), and even then, it may take more work to get the implications on a gut level.

I realize now that when I [wrote](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/) "You cannot make yourself believe the sky is green by an act of will", I wasn't just a dispassionate reporter of the existing facts.  I was also trying to instill a self-fulfilling prophecy.

It may be wise to go around deliberately repeating "I can't get away with double-thinking!  Deep down, I'll know it's not true!  If I know my map has no reason to be correlated with the territory, that means I don't believe it!"

Because that way—if you're ever tempted to try—the thoughts "But I know this isn't really true!" and "I can't fool myself!" will always rise readily to mind; and that way, you will indeed be less likely to fool yourself successfully.  You're more likely to get, on a gut level, that telling yourself X doesn't make X true: and therefore, really truly not-X.

If you keep telling yourself that you can't just deliberately choose to believe the sky is green—then you're less likely to succeed in fooling yourself on one level or another; either in the sense of really believing it, or of falling into [Moore's Paradox](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/), [belief in belief](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/belief-in-belie.html), or [belief in self-deception](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/s/belief_in_selfdeception/).

If you keep telling yourself that deep down you'll know—

If you keep telling yourself that you'd just look at your elaborately constructed false map, and just know that it was a false map without any expected correlation to the territory, and therefore, despite all its elaborate construction, you wouldn't be able to invest any credulity in it—

If you keep telling yourself that reflective consistency will take over and make you stop believing on the object level, once you come to the meta-level realization that the map is not reflecting—

Then when push comes to shove—you may, indeed, fail.

When it comes to deliberate self-deception, you must believe in your own inability!

Tell yourself the effort is doomed—and it will be!

Is that the power of positive thinking, or the power of negative thinking?  Either way, it seems like a wise precaution.
