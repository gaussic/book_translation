## 对自我欺骗的信仰

**作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky**

昨天我谈到了和一位名义上是正统派犹太教徒的女性之间的对话。她极力辩称自己相信上帝，而实际上似乎完全不相信。

当我问她相信上帝带来了哪些好处时，我向她介绍了[Tarski的陈词](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/curiosity.html)——实际上这是一组无限的陈词，其中一个具体例子是：

> *如果天空是蓝色的，*
> *我希望相信“天空是蓝色的”；*
> *如果天空不是蓝色的，*
> *我希望相信“天空不是蓝色的”。*

她对我说：“这不是我的哲学。”

我回应她：“我本来也不这么认为。我只是想问——假设上帝不存在，而且这是确定的，那么你还应该相信上帝吗？”

她犹豫了片刻。她似乎真的在努力思考，这让我很惊讶。

“所以这是个反事实问题……”她慢慢地说。

当时我以为她很难让自己设想一个没有上帝存在的世界，因为她对一个包含上帝的世界太过执着。

但现在，我怀疑她其实很难想象出“存在上帝”和“不存在上帝”这两种世界之间的区别。因为她的所有思维都围绕着“相信上帝”，而她建构世界因果关系的网络中，并没有“上帝”这一节点。所以她很容易回答“如果我不信上帝，世界会有什么不同？”，却不能回答“如果没有上帝，世界会有什么不同？”

她当时没有回答那个问题。但她给出了一个Tarski陈词的反例：

她说：“我相信人们比他们实际上更善良。”

我试图向她解释，如果你说“人们很糟糕”，那说明你**相信**人们很糟糕；如果你说“我相信人们是善良的”，那说明你**相信你相信**人们是善良的。所以，如果你说“人们很糟糕，但我相信人们是善良的”，那就是你**相信**人们很糟糕，但**相信自己相信**他们是善良的。

我引用了维特根斯坦的一句话：

> “如果有一个动词表示‘错误地相信’，那它在第一人称现在时中不会有任何意义。”
> ——路德维希·维特根斯坦

她微笑着说：“是的，我相信人们比实际上更善良。我只是想用你能理解的方式说出来。”

> “我看，沃尔特，奶奶应该好好看看你，”保姆说，“我猜你的脑子就像一团掉到地上的线球，全打结了。”
> ——特里·普拉切特，《假面舞会》

我可以写出这样一句话：“我猜她并不相信她的推理应该[在反思下保持一致](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/the-lens-that-s.html)，”但我仍然很难[理解这点](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/05/think_like_real.html)。

我能看出她说出来的话的模式，但无法在情感层面上理解她的心智。我能设身处地地想象自己是[吃婴儿的外星人](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/the-babyeating-aliens.html)，或是[第三代切嗣小姐](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/super-happy-people.html)，但我无法想象自己是她。或者说，我其实是不愿意去想象？

这就是为什么聪明人只有在有限的主观时间内（用来思考宗教的时间）才能成为无神论者。因为过了某个节点，如果你聪明，花了时间思考并辩护你的宗教，却仍然未能摆脱[黑暗面认识论](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/10/the-dark-side.html)的控制，你的内心就会变成一幅埃舍尔的画。

（另一个让她停顿的时刻——我提一下，或许你有机会用上——是她谈到“相信有人在乎你是否做对或做错这件事是件好事”。当然，她不是在谈论**真的有个上帝在乎你是否做对或做错**，因为这个命题并不属于她的宗教。

我说：“但我在乎你是否做对或做错。所以你是在说，这还不够，你还需要相信有个超越人类的存在在乎你是否做对或做错。”她顿住了，因为她当然从没这样想过。这只是一次[非标准工具箱的标准使用](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/how-to-seem-and.html)。）

后来，有一次我问她，如果明确知道上帝不存在，那在做事上会不会应该有什么不同？这次她回答说：“不会。”

我惊讶地说：“所以说，上帝存在与否，对人们该如何思考或行动**完全没有影响**？我想即使是个拉比听到这话，也会皱眉吧。”

她的宗教现在似乎完全变成了“对敬拜的敬拜”。就像过去真正的信徒会相信一个无所不见的天父会拯救他们，她现在则相信“相信上帝”会拯救她。

她说“我相信人们比实际更善良”后，我问：“那么，你是不是经常会对别人没达到你的期望而感到惊讶？”她沉默了很久，然后慢慢地说：“嗯……我会感到惊讶吗，当人们没达到我的期望时？”

我当时没理解这个停顿。我本意是暗示，如果她经常对现实感到失望，那这就是错误信念的一个弊端。但她似乎反而被“不感到惊讶”的含义吓了一跳。

我现在意识到，她整个哲学的核心在于**相信自己欺骗了自己**，而她对他人的评估其实可能是准确的这个可能性，动摇了她围绕“我从相信人们比实际更善良中受益”这种信念所建构的[黑暗面认识论](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/10/the-dark-side.html)。

她已将旧的偶像从神坛上拉下，换上了一个对黑暗面认识论的明确崇拜——那个原本是为了捍卫偶像而发明出来的认识论；她现在崇拜的是自己尝试自我欺骗的行为。这个尝试失败了，但她却完全没有意识到这一点。

因此，人类这群理智守护者的象征人物（座右铭：“从伊壁鸠鲁以来，我们就一直在给你那发疯的小派对泼冷水”）如今必须与**自我欺骗的主动崇拜**作斗争——即用对“信仰所带来好处”的崇拜，来取代对上帝的崇拜。

这其实解释了我自己身上一件以前不理解的事——为什么当人们说自我欺骗很容易时，我会感到烦躁，以及为什么我会写[整篇博客文章](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/doublethink-cho.html)来论证，故意选择相信“天空是绿色的”其实比人们想象的要难得多。

那是因为——虽然你不能简单地“选择”相信天空是绿色的——**如果你没有意识到这一点，你**实际上可以**骗过自己，让自己以为自己已经成功地欺骗了自己**。

而一旦你真诚地期待从自我欺骗中获得某种好处，你就能从这种“自我欺骗的信念”中获得一种**安慰剂式的效益**，就像你真的成功欺骗了自己一样。

所以，当我去说明自我欺骗的困难时，我实际上是在**直接攻击**那些人们从“我已经骗过自己”这一信念中得到的安慰剂效益，并且瞄准了那种**只崇拜对上帝的崇拜本身**的新型宗教。

我在想，这场斗争是否会引出一整套新的理由，用来证明不是“信仰”，而是[“对信仰的信仰”](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/belief-in-belie.html)本身是件好事？证明人们从“崇拜自己的崇拜”中获得了巨大好处？那我们是不是得再来一轮，讨论“对信仰的信仰


的信仰”，和“对崇拜的崇拜的崇拜”？还是说，有头脑的有神论者最终会放弃这一系列论证？

我真希望我能相信，没人会真的相信“对信仰的信仰的信仰”，但[哲学中的“僵尸世界”论证](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/zombies.html)已经比这还混乱了，而其支持者仍然没放弃。

我等着看评论区里那些为“对信仰的信仰”辩护的热情回应，但我也在想，是否有人愿意跳过一步，直接为“对信仰的信仰的信仰”辩护？早点说出来，早解决。

## Belief in Self-Deception

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

I spoke yesterday of my conversation with a nominally Orthodox Jewish woman who vigorously defended the assertion that she believed in God, while seeming not to actually believe in God at all.

While I was questioning her about the benefits that she thought came from believing in God, I introduced the [Litany of Tarski](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/curiosity.html)—which is actually an infinite family of litanies, a specific example being:

  _If the sky is blue_
      _I desire to believe "the sky is blue"_
  _If the sky is not blue_
      _I desire to believe "the sky is not blue"._

"This is not my philosophy," she said to me.

"I didn't think it was," I replied to her.  "I'm just asking—assuming that God does not exist, and this is known, then should you still believe in God?"

She hesitated.  She seemed to really be trying to think about it, which surprised me.

"So it's a counterfactual question..." she said slowly.

I thought at the time that she was having difficulty allowing herself to visualize the world where God does not exist, because of her attachment to a God-containing world.

Now, however, I suspect she was having difficulty visualizing a contrast between the way the world would look if God existed or did not exist, because all her thoughts were about her belief in God, but her causal network modelling the world did not contain God as a node.  So she could easily answer "How would the world look different if I didn't believe in God?", but not "How would the world look different if there was no God?"

She didn't answer that question, at the time.  But she did produce a counterexample to the Litany of Tarski:

She said, "I believe that people are nicer than they really are."


I tried to explain that if you say, "People are bad," that means you believe people are bad, and if you say, "I believe people are nice", that means you believe you believe people are nice.  So saying "People are bad and I believe people are nice" means you believe people are bad but you believe you believe people are nice.

I quoted to her:

  "If there were a verb meaning 'to believe falsely', it would not have any
  significant first person, present indicative."
          —Ludwig Wittgenstein

She said, smiling, "Yes, I believe people are nicer than, in fact, they are.  I just thought I should put it that way for you."

  "I reckon Granny ought to have a good look at you, Walter," said Nanny.  "I reckon
  your mind's all tangled up like a ball of string what's been dropped."
          —Terry Pratchett, Maskerade

And I can type out the words, "Well, I guess she didn't believe that her reasoning ought to be [consistent under reflection](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/the-lens-that-s.html)," but I'm still having trouble [coming to grips](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/05/think_like_real.html) with it.

I can see the pattern in the words coming out of her lips, but I can't understand the mind behind on an empathic level.  I can imagine myself into the shoes of [baby-eating aliens](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/the-babyeating-aliens.html) and the [Lady 3rd Kiritsugu](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/super-happy-people.html), but I cannot imagine what it is like to be her.  Or maybe I just don't want to?

This is why intelligent people only have a certain amount of time (measured in subjective time spent thinking about religion) to become atheists.  After a certain point, if you're smart, have spent time thinking about and defending your religion, and still haven't escaped the grip of [Dark Side Epistemology](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/10/the-dark-side.html), the inside of your mind ends up as an Escher painting.

(One of the other few moments that gave her pause—I mention this, in case you have occasion to use it—is when she was talking about how it's good to believe that someone cares whether you do right or wrong—not, of course, talking about how there actually is a God who cares whether you do right or wrong, this proposition is not part of her religion—

And I said, "But I care whether you do right or wrong.  So what you're saying is that this isn't enough, and you also need to believe in something above humanity that cares whether you do right or wrong."  So that stopped her, for a bit, because of course she'd never thought of it in those terms before.  Just [a standard application of the nonstandard toolbox](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/how-to-seem-and.html).)

Later on, at one point, I was asking her if it would be good to do anything differently if there definitely was no God, and this time, she answered, "No."

"So," I said incredulously, "if God exists or doesn't exist, that has absolutely no effect on how it would be good for people to think or act?  I think even a rabbi would look a little askance at that."

Her religion seems to now consist entirely of the worship of worship.  As the true believers of older times might have believed that an all-seeing father would save them, she now believes that belief in God will save her.

After she said "I believe people are nicer than they are," I asked, "So, are you consistently surprised when people undershoot your expectations?"  There was a long silence, and then, slowly:  "Well... am I surprised when people... undershoot my expectations?"

I didn't understand this pause at the time.  I'd intended it to suggest that if she was constantly disappointed by reality, then this was a downside of believing falsely.   But she seemed, instead, to be taken aback at the implications of not being surprised.

I now realize that the whole essence of her philosophy was her belief that she had deceived herself, and the possibility that her estimates of other people were actually accurate, threatened the [Dark Side Epistemology](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/10/the-dark-side.html) that she had built around beliefs such as "I benefit from believing people are nicer than they actually are."

She has taken the old idol off its throne, and replaced it with an explicit worship of the Dark Side Epistemology that was once invented to defend the idol; she worships her own attempt at self-deception.  The attempt failed, but she is honestly unaware of this.

And so humanity's token guardians of sanity (motto: "pooping your deranged little party since Epicurus") must now fight the active worship of self-deception—the worship of the supposed benefits of faith, in place of God.

This actually explains a fact about myself that I didn't really understand earlier—the reason why I'm annoyed when people talk as if self-deception is easy, and why I write [entire blog posts](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/doublethink-cho.html) arguing that making a deliberate choice to believe the sky is green, is harder to get away with than people seem to think.

It's because—while you can't just choose to believe the sky is green—if you don't realize this fact, then you actually can fool yourself into believing that you've successfully deceived yourself.

And since you then sincerely expect to receive the benefits that you think come from self-deception, you get the same sort of placebo benefit that would actually come from a successful self-deception.

So by going around explaining how hard self-deception is, I'm actually taking direct aim at the placebo benefits that people get from believing that they've deceived themselves, and targeting the new sort of religion that worships only the worship of God.

Will this battle, I wonder, generate a new list of reasons why, not belief, but [belief in belief](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/belief-in-belie.html), is itself a good thing?  Why people derive great benefits from worshipping their worship?  Will we have to do this over again with belief in belief in belief and worship of worship of worship?  Or will intelligent theists finally just give up on that line of argument?

I wish I could believe that no one could possibly believe in belief in belief in belief, but [the Zombie World argument in philosophy has gotten even more tangled than this](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/zombies.html) and its proponents still haven't abandoned it.

I await the eager defenses of belief in belief in the comments, but I wonder if anyone would care to jump ahead of the game and defend belief in belief in belief?  Might as well go ahead and get it over with.
