## 别相信你能自欺

我并不是要针对 Kurige，但如果你在 Less Wrong 上[这样说](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/r/no_really_ive_deceived_myself/#gk)，你就得预料到会被质疑：

> 我逐渐意识到，导致我和大多数其他基督徒交流时感到差异的原因，是我的世界观在某个阶段从盲信转向了类似奥威尔式双重思想的状态。

“如果你知道这就是[双重思想](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/doublethink-cho.html)……

……你怎么还能相信它呢？”我忍不住想这么问。

[或者](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/#u3)：

我选择相信上帝的存在——是有意识、刻意做出的决定。然而，这个决定对上帝是否真的存在完全没有影响。

如果你知道自己的信念和现实无关，你怎么还能相信它？

难道不应该在你意识到“我的地图上写着‘天空是绿色的’，但这和现实没有任何关联”之后，直觉上就明白“哦，等等，天空其实并不是绿色的”吗？

但……显然不是这样。

这个谜题的一部分，可能是我对[摩尔悖论](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/)（“正在下雨，但我并不相信在下雨”）的解释——人们在内省时会把对某个“被引号包裹的信念”所附带的正面情感，误认为是真正的信任。

但另一部分原因可能只是——和我最初想要表达的愤慨相反——其实人们很容易不从“反映现实的地图会说‘X’”跳到“真的相信X”。要解释[大脑是地图-领地对应构建器](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/what-is-evidenc.html)的思想需要一些功夫，即使如此，要让人们在直觉层面明白其含义还需要更多努力。

我现在意识到，当我[写下](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/)“你无法靠意志让自己相信天空是绿色的”时，我不仅仅是在冷静陈述事实。我其实也在试图灌输一种自我实现的预言。

也许有意识地反复告诉自己“我无法靠双重思想蒙混过关！内心深处我会知道这不是真的！如果我知道我的地图和现实没有关联，那就说明我并不相信它！”是明智的。

因为这样——如果你哪天真的想尝试自欺——“但我知道这其实不是真的！”和“我骗不了自己！”这些念头就会很容易浮现出来；这样，你确实就更难真正骗过自己。你更容易在直觉层面明白，告诉自己X并不会让X变成真的：因此，实际上你真的不会相信X。

如果你一直告诉自己，不能靠意志选择相信天空是绿色的——那么你在某种程度上就更难骗过自己；无论是指真的相信了，还是陷入了[摩尔悖论](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/)、[信仰信仰](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/belief-in-belie.html)或[相信自己能自欺](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/s/belief_in_selfdeception/)的陷阱。

如果你一直告诉自己，内心深处你会知道——

如果你一直告诉自己，你只会看着自己精心构建的虚假地图，然后明白那只是一张和现实没有任何预期关联的假地图，因此，无论它多么精致，你都无法真正信任它——

如果你一直告诉自己，一旦你在元层面意识到地图没有反映现实，反思一致性就会接管，让你在对象层面停止相信——

那么，到了关键时刻——你可能真的会失败。

面对有意自欺时，你必须相信自己做不到！

告诉自己这种努力注定失败——它就真的会失败！

这是积极思维的力量，还是消极思维的力量？无论如何，这似乎都是明智的预防措施。

## Don't Believe You'll Self-Deceive

I don't mean to seem like I'm picking on Kurige, but I think you have to expect a certain amount of questioning if you show up on Less Wrong and [say](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/r/no_really_ive_deceived_myself/#gk):

> One thing I've come to realize that helps to explain the disparity I feel when I talk with most other Christians is the fact that somewhere along the way my world-view took a major shift away from blind faith and landed somewhere in the vicinity of Orwellian double-think.

"If you know it's [double-think](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/doublethink-cho.html)...

...how can you still believe it?" I helplessly want to say.

[Or](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/#u3):

I chose to believe in the existence of God—deliberately and consciously. This decision, however, has absolutely zero effect on the actual existence of God.

If you know your belief isn't correlated to reality, how can you still believe it?

Shouldn't the gut-level realization, "Oh, wait, the sky really isn't green" follow from the realization "My map that says 'the sky is green' has no reason to be correlated with the territory"?

Well... apparently not.

One part of this puzzle may be my explanation of [Moore's Paradox](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/) ("It's raining, but I don't believe it is")—that people introspectively mistake positive affect attached to a quoted belief, for actual credulity.

But another part of it may just be that—contrary to the indignation I initially wanted to put forward—it's actually quite easy not to make the jump from "The map that reflects the territory would say 'X'" to actually believing "X".  It takes some work to explain the ideas of [minds as map-territory correspondence builders](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/what-is-evidenc.html), and even then, it may take more work to get the implications on a gut level.

I realize now that when I [wrote](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/) "You cannot make yourself believe the sky is green by an act of will", I wasn't just a dispassionate reporter of the existing facts.  I was also trying to instill a self-fulfilling prophecy.

It may be wise to go around deliberately repeating "I can't get away with double-thinking!  Deep down, I'll know it's not true!  If I know my map has no reason to be correlated with the territory, that means I don't believe it!"

Because that way—if you're ever tempted to try—the thoughts "But I know this isn't really true!" and "I can't fool myself!" will always rise readily to mind; and that way, you will indeed be less likely to fool yourself successfully.  You're more likely to get, on a gut level, that telling yourself X doesn't make X true: and therefore, really truly not-X.

If you keep telling yourself that you can't just deliberately choose to believe the sky is green—then you're less likely to succeed in fooling yourself on one level or another; either in the sense of really believing it, or of falling into [Moore's Paradox](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/), [belief in belief](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/belief-in-belie.html), or [belief in self-deception](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/s/belief_in_selfdeception/).

If you keep telling yourself that deep down you'll know—

If you keep telling yourself that you'd just look at your elaborately constructed false map, and just know that it was a false map without any expected correlation to the territory, and therefore, despite all its elaborate construction, you wouldn't be able to invest any credulity in it—

If you keep telling yourself that reflective consistency will take over and make you stop believing on the object level, once you come to the meta-level realization that the map is not reflecting—

Then when push comes to shove—you may, indeed, fail.

When it comes to deliberate self-deception, you must believe in your own inability!

Tell yourself the effort is doomed—and it will be!

Is that the power of positive thinking, or the power of negative thinking?  Either way, it seems like a wise precaution.
