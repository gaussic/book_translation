## 不，真的，我欺骗了自己

最近我和一个人聊过……很难形容。名义上，她是一位正统犹太教徒。她也非常聪明，对一些反对她宗教的考古证据以及宗教人士都知道的那些肤浅的反宗教论点都很熟悉。比如，她知道莫迪凯、以斯帖、哈曼和瓦什提并未出现在波斯的历史记录中，但有一个与之对应的古波斯传说，讲的是巴比伦神祇马尔杜克和伊什塔尔，以及对立的埃兰神祇胡曼和瓦什提。她明明知道这些，依然庆祝普珥节。她属于那种在自我矛盾中反复纠结、不断修饰和调整，直到内心世界像M.C.埃舍尔画作一样复杂的高智商宗教人士。

大多数这样的人会[假装自己太聪明](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/pretending-to-be-wise.html)而不屑与无神论者对话，但她愿意和我聊了几个小时。

因此，我现在至少明白了关于自我欺骗的又一件事——那就是，只要你相信自己已经欺骗了自己，其实并不需要真的欺骗自己。可以称之为“对自我欺骗的信念”。

这个女人在高中时，曾认为自己是无神论者。但那时她决定，自己应该像相信上帝一样去行动。然后——她很认真地告诉我——随着时间推移，她真的开始相信上帝了。

据我观察，她其实完全错了。在我们整个对话过程中，她一直反复说“我相信上帝”，却从未说过“有一位上帝”。当我问她为什么信教时，她从未谈论过上帝存在的后果，只谈论相信上帝的后果。她从不说“上帝会帮助我”，而总是说“我对上帝的信仰帮助了我”。当我对她说，“一个只想要真相、观察我们宇宙的人，根本不会把上帝当作假说提出”，她也直接表示同意。

她其实并没有真的欺骗自己去相信上帝存在，或犹太教是真的。据我判断，甚至差得很远。

另一方面，我认为她确实相信自己已经欺骗了自己。

所以，尽管她并没有因为相信上帝而获得任何好处——因为她其实并不信——但她真诚地相信自己已经欺骗了自己去相信上帝，因此她真诚地期待能获得那些与自我欺骗式信仰相关的好处；我猜，这应该能产生和真正相信上帝差不多的安慰剂效应。

这也许解释了，为什么她会如此认真地为“我相信上帝”这句话辩护，面对我的怀疑追问时，却从未说过“顺便说一句，上帝真的存在”，甚至对这个命题本身也毫无兴趣。

## No, Really, I've Deceived Myself

I recently spoke with a person who... it's difficult to describe.  Nominally, she was an Orthodox Jew.  She was also highly intelligent, conversant with some of the archaeological evidence against her religion, and the shallow standard arguments against religion that religious people know about.  For example, she knew that Mordecai, Esther, Haman, and Vashti were not in the Persian historical records, but that there was a corresponding old Persian legend about the Babylonian gods Marduk and Ishtar, and the rival Elamite gods Humman and Vashti.  She knows this, and she still celebrates Purim.  One of those highly intelligent religious people who stew in their own contradictions for years, elaborating and tweaking, until their minds look like the inside of an M. C. Escher painting.

Most people like this will [pretend that they are much too wise](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/pretending-to-be-wise.html) to talk to atheists, but she was willing to talk with me for a few hours.

As a result, I now understand at least one more thing about self-deception that I didn't explicitly understand before—namely, that you don't have to really deceive yourself so long as you believe you've deceived yourself.  Call it "belief in self-deception".

When this woman was in high school, she thought she was an atheist.  But she decided, at that time, that she should act as if she believed in God.  And then—she told me earnestly—over time, she came to really believe in God.

So far as I can tell, she is completely wrong about that.  Always throughout our conversation, she said, over and over, "I believe in God", never once, "There is a God."  When I asked her why she was religious, she never once talked about the consequences of God existing, only about the consequences of believing in God.  Never, "God will help me", always, "my belief in God helps me".  When I put to her, "Someone who just wanted the truth and looked at our universe would not even invent God as a hypothesis," she agreed outright.

She hasn't actually deceived herself into believing that God exists or that the Jewish religion is true.  Not even close, so far as I can tell.

On the other hand, I think she really does believe she has deceived herself.

So although she does not receive any benefit of believing in God—because she doesn't—she honestly believes she has deceived herself into believing in God, and so she honestly expects to receive the benefits that she associates with deceiving oneself into believing in God; and that, I suppose, ought to produce much the same placebo effect as actually believing in God.

And this may explain why she was motivated to earnestly defend the statement that she believed in God from my skeptical questioning, while never saying "Oh, and by the way, God actually does exist" or even seeming the slightest bit interested in the proposition.
