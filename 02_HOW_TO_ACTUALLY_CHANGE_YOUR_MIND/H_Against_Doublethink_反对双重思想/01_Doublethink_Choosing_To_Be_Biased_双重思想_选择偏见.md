## 双重思想（选择偏见）

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

> 一张长方形的报纸剪影出现在奥布莱恩的手指间。大约五秒钟，它处在温斯顿的视野角度内。那是一张照片，毫无疑问是那张照片——是琼斯、阿伦森和卢瑟福在纽约出席党的活动时的合影，那是十一年前他偶然发现并立刻销毁的那张照片的另一份副本。它只在他眼前一瞬间，然后又消失了。但他确实看见了，毫无疑问他看见了！他拼命地、痛苦地试图扭动上半身挣脱束缚，但无论朝哪个方向都无法移动哪怕一厘米。他甚至暂时忘记了那个拨盘。他只想再一次拿到那张照片，哪怕只是再看它一眼。

> “它存在！”他喊道。

> “不，”奥布莱恩说。

> 他走过房间。

> 对面墙上有一个记忆孔。奥布莱恩掀开格栅。那张脆弱的纸片在温暖气流的带动下无声旋转，瞬间被火焰吞没。奥布莱恩从墙边转过身。

> “灰烬，”他说，“连可以辨认的灰烬都没有。只是尘埃。它不存在。它从未存在过。”

> “可它确实存在过！它现在还存在！它存在于记忆中。我记得它。你也记得它。”

> “我不记得了，”奥布莱恩说。

> 温斯顿的心沉了下去。这就是双重思想。他感到一种致命的无力感。如果他能确定奥布莱恩在撒谎，那倒也无所谓。但完全有可能，奥布莱恩是真的忘记了那张照片。如果真是那样，那么他也已经忘记了自己是否否认过记得它，也忘记了自己忘记这件事的过程。人怎么能确认这不是一场把戏？也许，这种精神错乱是真正可能发生的：就是这个念头让他彻底崩溃。

如果自我欺骗能让我们更快乐呢？如果摆脱偏见，反而让我们——天哪！——变得不快乐呢？当然，真正的智慧可能是“二阶理性”：选择何时理性。这样一来，你就可以决定让哪些认知偏见来支配你，从而最大化你的幸福。

先不谈道德问题，我怀疑那种精神错乱真的可能发生。

“二阶理性”意味着你会在某个时刻对自己说：“现在，我将非理性地相信自己会中彩票，以此让自己开心。”但我们对自己的信念没有这种直接控制力。你无法通过意志力让自己相信天空是绿色的。你或许能**相信你相信了**它——不过我现在指出了这种区别，已经让你更难这么做了（不客气！）。你甚至可能相信自己很幸福、也自我欺骗了；但你实际上既不幸福，也未被欺骗。

如果要让“二阶理性”真正合乎理性，你首先得对现实有一个准确的模型，以便预测理性与非理性的后果。然后，如果你选择成为“一阶非理性”的人，你必须遗忘这个准确的视角。然后还要忘记你遗忘的这个行为。我不想犯“以虚构作为证据”的逻辑谬误，但我认为奥威尔确实很出色地推演出了这条路的尽头。

在你摆脱偏见之前，你不可能知道偏见的后果。而一旦你摆脱了，就已经来不及再欺骗自己了。

另一个选择就是盲目地选择继续偏见，不去清楚了解后果。这不是“二阶理性”。这是**有意识地愚蠢**。

如果你对自己的驾驶技能保持非理性的乐观，你就能在别人紧张、恐惧的时候轻松愉快地开车。你不用忍受安全带的麻烦。你可能会轻松愉快地开车过一天、一周、一年。然后“砰！”一声，度过余生都在忍受幻肢的瘙痒，或颈部以下瘫痪，或当场死亡。这不是必然的，但是可能的；那么可能性有多大？除非你了解自己的真实驾驶技能，了解自己到底处于多大风险中，否则你无法理性地做出这种权衡。除非你了解像“概率忽视”这样的偏见，否则你无法理性评估这种风险。

无论你在无知的幸福中度过多少天，一次错误就足以毁掉你的一生，胜过你从“愚蠢铁轨”上捡来的所有零钱。

我给那些渴望成为理性主义者的人最重要的建议之一是：“不要耍聪明。”还有：“倾听那些微弱的、挥之不去的疑虑。”如果你不知道，那你就不知道你不知道的是什么，也不知道你不知道了多少，也不知道你原本应该知道多少。

**没有“二阶理性”这回事。** 你面对的只有一次盲目的跳跃，不知道前方是不是火山熔岩坑。一旦你知道真相，盲目已不可能。

但人们之所以忽视这一点，是因为他们**不知道自己不知道的东西**。那些“未知的未知”是不可感知的。他们不会专注于地图上的空白区域，而是把它当作现实中没有东西的地带。于是当他们考虑盲目跳跃时，他们会在记忆中搜索危险的信号，而在那张空白地图中找不到任何“熔岩坑”。那为什么不跳？

我跳过。我试过。被烧伤了。**别试图耍聪明。**

我曾对一个朋友说，我怀疑“愚蠢的幸福”被严重高估了。她严肃地摇摇头，说：“不，真的没有被高估。真的没有。”

也许外面确实有些愚蠢又幸福的人。也许他们确实比你快乐。人生本来就不公平，而你也不会因为嫉妒得不到的东西而更快乐。我怀疑，大多数阅读《克服偏见》的读者，即便想要，也达不到“愚蠢的幸福”。那条路对你来说已经关闭了。你无法达到那种无知的程度，你无法遗忘你所知道的事，你无法对你所看到的视而不见。

**“愚蠢的幸福”之路对你已经关闭。** 除非你真的遭受脑损伤，否则你永远无法再拥有它——甚至即便如此也不一定能得到。

我认为你应该思考一下，“愚蠢的幸福”是否是最优解——是否是人类所能追求的最大幸福。但这已经不重要了。**那条路，若曾经存在，也已经对你关闭。**

现在剩下的唯一选择，就是追求一个理性主义者所能达到的幸福。我认为，它最终可能更为伟大。世上有些道路是有限的，有些是无尽的；有些是可以懒散休憩的平台，有些则是需奋力攀登的山峰；而攀登虽更辛苦，但终究能登得更高。

而且，人生不仅仅是为了幸福；你做出的决策，还可能影响到他人的幸福。

但这也无关紧要了。当你意识到你拥有选择的时候，你其实已经没有选择了。你无法对你所看到的视而不见。**那条路已不复存在。**

## Doublethink (Choosing to be Biased)

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

> An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between O'Brien's fingers. For perhaps five seconds it was within the angle of Winston's vision. It was a photograph, and there was no question of its identity. It was the photograph. It was another copy of the photograph of Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford at the party function in New York, which he had chanced upon eleven years ago and promptly destroyed. For only an instant it was before his eyes, then it was out of sight again. But he had seen it, unquestionably he had seen it! He made a desperate, agonizing effort to wrench the top half of his body free. It was impossible to move so much as a centimetre in any direction. For the moment he had even forgotten the dial. All he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again, or at least to see it.
> 
> 'It exists!' he cried.
> 
> 'No,' said O'Brien.
> 
> He stepped across the room.
> 
> There was a memory hole in the opposite wall. O'Brien lifted the grating. Unseen, the frail slip of paper was whirling away on the current of warm air; it was vanishing in a flash of flame. O'Brien turned away from the wall.
> 
> 'Ashes,' he said. 'Not even identifiable ashes. Dust. It does not exist. It never existed.'
> 
> 'But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in memory. I remember it. You remember it.'
> 
> 'I do not remember it,' said O'Brien.
> 
> Winston's heart sank. That was doublethink. He had a feeling of deadly helplessness. If he could have been certain that O'Brien was lying, it would not have seemed to matter. But it was perfectly possible that O'Brien had really forgotten the photograph. And if so, then already he would have forgotten his denial of remembering it, and forgotten the act of forgetting. How could one be sure that it was simple trickery? Perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen: that was the thought that defeated him.

What if self-deception helps us be happy?  What if just running out and overcoming bias will make us—gasp!—unhappy?  Surely, true wisdom would be second-order rationality, choosing when to be rational.  That way you can decide which cognitive biases should govern you, to maximize your happiness.

Leaving the morality aside, I doubt such a lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen.


Second-order rationality implies that at some point, you will think to yourself, "And now, I will irrationally believe that I will win the lottery, in order to make myself happy."  But we do not have such direct control over our beliefs.  You cannot make yourself believe the sky is green by an act of will.  You might be able to [believe you believed](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/) it—though I have just made that more difficult for you by pointing out the difference.  (You're welcome!)  You might even believe you were happy and self-deceived; but you would not in fact be happy and self-deceived.

For second-order rationality to be genuinely rational, you would first need a good model of reality, to extrapolate the consequences of rationality and irrationality.  If you then chose to be first-order irrational, you would need to forget this accurate view. And then forget the act of forgetting.  I don't mean to commit the logical fallacy of generalizing from fictional evidence, but I think Orwell did a good job of extrapolating where this path leads.

You can't know the consequences of being biased, until you have already debiased yourself.  And then it is too late for self-deception.

The other alternative is to choose blindly to remain biased, without any clear idea of the consequences.  This is not second-order rationality.  It is willful stupidity.

Be irrationally optimistic about your driving skills, and you will be happily unconcerned where others sweat and fear.  You won't have to put up with the inconvenience of a seatbelt.  You will be happily unconcerned for a day, a week, a year.  Then CRASH, and spend the rest of your life wishing you could scratch the itch in your phantom limb.  Or paralyzed from the neck down.  Or dead.  It's not inevitable, but it's possible; how probable is it?  You can't make that tradeoff rationally unless you know your real driving skills, so you can figure out how much danger you're placing yourself in.  You can't make that tradeoff rationally unless you know about biases like [neglect of probability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neglect_of_probability).

No matter how many days go by in blissful ignorance, it only takes a single mistake to undo a human life, to outweigh every penny you picked up from the railroad tracks of stupidity.

One of chief pieces of advice I give to aspiring rationalists is "Don't try to be clever." And, "Listen to those quiet, nagging doubts."  If you don't know, you don't know what you don't know, you don't know how much you don't know, and you don't know how much you needed to know.

There is no second-order rationality.  There is only a blind leap into what may or may not be a flaming lava pit.  Once you know, it will be too late for blindness.

But people neglect this, because they do not know what they do not know.  Unknown unknowns are not [available](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/j5/availability/). They do not focus on the blank area on the map, but treat it as if it corresponded to a blank territory.  When they consider leaping blindly, they check their memory for dangers, and find no flaming lava pits in the blank map.  Why not leap?

Been there.  Tried that.  Got burned.  Don't try to be clever.

I once said to a friend that I suspected the happiness of stupidity was greatly overrated.  And she shook her head seriously, and said, "No, it's not; it's really not."

Maybe there are stupid happy people out there.  Maybe they are happier than you are.  And life isn't fair, and you won't become happier by being jealous of what you can't have.  I suspect the vast majority of Overcoming Bias readers could not achieve the "happiness of stupidity" if they tried.  That way is closed to you. You can never achieve that degree of ignorance, you cannot forget what you know, you cannot unsee what you see. 

The happiness of stupidity is closed to you.  You will never have it short of actual brain damage, and maybe not even then.  You should wonder, I think, whether the happiness of stupidity is optimal—if it is the most happiness that a human can aspire to—but it matters not.  That way is closed to you, if it was ever open.

All that is left to you now, is to aspire to such happiness as a rationalist can achieve.  I think it may prove greater, in the end. There are bounded paths and open-ended paths; plateaus on which to laze, and mountains to climb; and if climbing takes more effort, still the mountain rises higher in the end.

Also there is more to life than happiness; and other happinesses than your own may be at stake in your decisions.

But that is moot.  By the time you realize you have a choice, there is no choice.  You cannot unsee what you see.  The other way is closed.
