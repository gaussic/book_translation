## 不，我说真的，我欺骗了自己

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

我最近和一个人谈了谈……很难描述她。名义上，她是一个东正教犹太人。她也非常聪明，对某些与她宗教相悖的考古证据十分了解，也熟悉那些宗教人士都知道的、肤浅的反宗教论点。

举个例子，她知道末底改（Mordecai）、以斯帖（Esther）、哈曼（Haman）和瓦实提（Vashti）这些人物并未出现在波斯的历史记录中，而是与一则关于巴比伦神祇马尔杜克（Marduk）和伊什塔尔（Ishtar），以及对立的埃兰神祇胡曼（Humman）和瓦实提的古老波斯传说相对应。她知道这些，但仍然庆祝普珥节（Purim）。她是那种高度聪明但又长年沉浸在自我矛盾中的宗教人士，反复构思、修补，直到她的思想看起来就像是M.C.埃舍尔的画作内景。

大多数这样的人会 [假装自己太过睿智](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/pretending-to-be-wise.html),以至于不会跟无神论者交谈，但她愿意和我聊了几个小时。

因此，我现在明白了关于自我欺骗的一点新东西——即，你不需要真的欺骗自己，只要你**相信你欺骗了自己**就可以。姑且称之为“对自我欺骗的信念”。

这个女人在高中时认为自己是个无神论者。但她当时决定，自己应该表现得像是相信上帝一样。接着——她认真地告诉我——随着时间的推移，她真的开始相信上帝了。

就我所能判断的而言，她对此完全错了。在我们的整场对话中，她一直不断重复“我相信上帝”，却从未说过“上帝存在”。当我问她为何信仰宗教时，她从未提到上帝存在会带来怎样的后果，只谈及**相信上帝**所带来的后果。她从不说“上帝会帮助我”，而是说“我对上帝的信仰帮助了我”。当我向她提出：“一个只追求真相的人，如果审视我们的宇宙，是不会把‘上帝’这个概念当作假设发明出来的”，她竟直接表示同意。

她并没有真的欺骗自己去相信“上帝存在”或者“犹太教是真理”。就我看，连边都没碰上。

另一方面，我认为她**真的相信自己欺骗了自己**。

所以，尽管她并没有获得“相信上帝”本身所带来的好处——因为她其实并不信——但她真心相信自己已经欺骗了自己去相信上帝，于是她也真心期待能从这种自我欺骗中获得相应的好处；而这，大概就能产生类似真正相信上帝那样的安慰剂效应。

这也许能解释，为什么她在面对我质疑时，会认真地为“我相信上帝”这一声明辩护，却从未说过“顺便一提，上帝确实存在”，甚至对这个命题本身也完全不感兴趣。

## No, Really, I've Deceived Myself

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

I recently spoke with a person who... it's difficult to describe.  Nominally, she was an Orthodox Jew.  She was also highly intelligent, conversant with some of the archaeological evidence against her religion, and the shallow standard arguments against religion that religious people know about.  For example, she knew that Mordecai, Esther, Haman, and Vashti were not in the Persian historical records, but that there was a corresponding old Persian legend about the Babylonian gods Marduk and Ishtar, and the rival Elamite gods Humman and Vashti.  She knows this, and she still celebrates Purim.  One of those highly intelligent religious people who stew in their own contradictions for years, elaborating and tweaking, until their minds look like the inside of an M. C. Escher painting.

Most people like this will [pretend that they are much too wise](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/pretending-to-be-wise.html) to talk to atheists, but she was willing to talk with me for a few hours.

As a result, I now understand at least one more thing about self-deception that I didn't explicitly understand before—namely, that you don't have to really deceive yourself so long as you believe you've deceived yourself.  Call it "belief in self-deception".

When this woman was in high school, she thought she was an atheist.  But she decided, at that time, that she should act as if she believed in God.  And then—she told me earnestly—over time, she came to really believe in God.

So far as I can tell, she is completely wrong about that.  Always throughout our conversation, she said, over and over, "I believe in God", never once, "There is a God."  When I asked her why she was religious, she never once talked about the consequences of God existing, only about the consequences of believing in God.  Never, "God will help me", always, "my belief in God helps me".  When I put to her, "Someone who just wanted the truth and looked at our universe would not even invent God as a hypothesis," she agreed outright.

She hasn't actually deceived herself into believing that God exists or that the Jewish religion is true.  Not even close, so far as I can tell.

On the other hand, I think she really does believe she has deceived herself.

So although she does not receive any benefit of believing in God—because she doesn't—she honestly believes she has deceived herself into believing in God, and so she honestly expects to receive the benefits that she associates with deceiving oneself into believing in God; and that, I suppose, ought to produce much the same placebo effect as actually believing in God.

And this may explain why she was motivated to earnestly defend the statement that she believed in God from my skeptical questioning, while never saying "Oh, and by the way, God actually does exist" or even seeming the slightest bit interested in the proposition.
