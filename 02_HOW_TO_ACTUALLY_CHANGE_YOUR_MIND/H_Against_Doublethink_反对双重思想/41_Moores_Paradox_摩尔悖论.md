## 摩尔悖论

在阅读了 Less Wrong 上的一些评论后，我觉得自己对摩尔悖论有了更深的理解。[Jimrandomh](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/r/no_really_ive_deceived_myself/#ga) 提出：

> 很多人无法区分间接性的层级。对他们来说，“我相信X”和“X”是同一回事，因此，认为相信X有好处的理由，也就是X为真的理由。

我认为这并不正确——相对年幼的孩子都能理解“有错误信念”这个概念，这需要把“地图”和“领地”分开处理。但这个观点确实指向了类似的想法：

许多人可能并没有在意识层面区分“相信某事”和“认同某事”。

毕竟，“我相信民主”在口语中其实是“我支持民主理念”，而不是“我相信民主这个东西存在”。所以，“belief（信仰/信念）”这个词其实有不止一种含义。我们可能面对的是一个[混淆的词汇](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/02/compress-fallac.html)，它导致了混乱的思维（或者说它只是反映了原本就存在的混乱）。

所以，在[最初的例子](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/s/belief_in_selfdeception/)中，“我相信人们比实际更善良”，她想出了相信人善良会带来健康等好处，于是对“相信人善良”这个想法产生了温暖的情感，然后她内省这种温暖感受，得出“我相信人善良”这个结论。也就是说，她把对这个信念的积极情感误认为是自己真的相信了这个命题。与此同时，现实世界看起来人们并没有那么善良。所以她说：“我相信人们比实际更善良。”

这其实接近于一种“诚实的错误”——某种程度上——因为人们并没有被明确教导如何判断自己是否真的相信某事。就像[车库里的龙](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/belief-in-belie.html)的寓言；那个说“我车库里有条龙——但它是隐形的”的人，并没有意识到自己预期看不到龙，其实说明他头脑中的模型里根本没有龙。

人们并没有被训练去识别自己何时相信了某事。高中里也没人教过：“真正相信某事的感觉——也就是这个陈述真的进入了你的信念池——就是它看起来就像世界本来的样子。你应该学会识别这种感觉，这才是真正的（非引号式的）信念，并把它和你对某个信念有好感但知道那只是个信念（即加了引号的信念）区分开来。”

这很大程度上让现实中的摩尔悖论[看起来没那么陌生](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/s/belief_in_selfdeception/)，也为人们如何能[同时对又错](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1d/simultaneously_right_and_wrong/)提供了另一种机制。

同样，[Kurige](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/r/no_really_ive_deceived_myself/#gk) 写道：

我相信有一位上帝——而且祂在我们心中植入了善恶的观念，使我们能够评判周围的世界。我也相信道德感是进化赋予我们的——很可能源于很久以前倭黑猩猩群体中元政治联盟的形成。这两种信念并不矛盾，但复杂之处在于如何调和二者。

我猜，Kurige，你是觉得自己有理由认同“上帝赋予我们善恶观念”这个信念，同时也有理由认同科学的结论。这两个群体都值得加入，对吧？两套信念都有好处？你内省后发现自己对两种信念都感觉良好？

但你并没有说：

“上帝赋予了我们善恶观念，同时道德感也是进化赋予我们的。这两种现实状态并不矛盾，复杂之处在于如何调和二者。”

Kurige，如果你正在读这段话，你应该立刻把上面这句话大声说出来，这样你就能注意到它至少更难说出口一点——注意这种主观上的差异——在你费劲心思重新合理化之前。

这就是“有理由认同两种不同信念”与“你头脑中只有一个世界、一个现实状态的模型”之间的主观差别。

## Moore's Paradox

I think I understand Moore's Paradox a bit better now, after reading some of the comments on Less Wrong. [Jimrandomh](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/r/no_really_ive_deceived_myself/#ga) suggests:

> Many people cannot distinguish between levels of indirection. To them, "I believe X" and "X" are the same thing, and therefore, reasons why it is beneficial to believe X are also reasons why X is true.

I don't think this is correct—relatively young children can understand the concept of having a false belief, which requires separate mental buckets for the map and the territory.  But it points in the direction of a similar idea:

Many people may not consciously distinguish between believing something and endorsing it.

After all—"I believe in democracy" means, colloquially, that you endorse the concept of democracy, not that you believe democracy exists.  The word "belief", then, has more than one meaning.  We could be looking at a [confused word](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/02/compress-fallac.html) that causes confused thinking (or maybe it just reflects pre-existing confusion).

So: in the [original example](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/s/belief_in_selfdeception/), "I believe people are nicer than they are", she came up with some reasons why it would be good to believe people are nice—health benefits and such—and since she now had some warm affect on "believing people are nice", she introspected on this warm affect and concluded, "I believe people are nice".  That is, she mistook the positive affect attached to the quoted belief, as signaling her belief in the proposition.  At the same time, the world itself seemed like people weren't so nice.  So she said, "I believe people are nicer than they are."

And that verges on being an honest mistake—sort of—since people are not taught explicitly how to know when they believe something.  As in the parable of the [dragon in the garage](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/belief-in-belie.html); the one who says "There is a dragon in my garage—but it's invisible", does not recognize his anticipation of seeing no dragon, as indicating that he possesses an (accurate) model with no dragon in it.

It's not as if people are trained to recognize when they believe something.  It's not like they're ever taught in high school:  "What it feels like to actually believe something—to have that statement in your belief pool—is that it just seems like the way the world is.  You should recognize this feeling, which is actual (unquoted) belief, and distinguish it from having good feelings about a belief that you recognize as a belief (which means that it's in quote marks)."

This goes a long way toward making this real-life case of Moore's Paradox [seem less alien](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/s/belief_in_selfdeception/), and providing another mechanism whereby people can be [simultaneously right and wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1d/simultaneously_right_and_wrong/).

Likewise [Kurige](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/r/no_really_ive_deceived_myself/#gk) who wrote:

I believe that there is a God—and that He has instilled a sense of right and wrong in us by which we are able to evaluate the world around us.  I also believe a sense of morality has been evolutionarily programmed into us—a sense of morality that is most likely a result of the formation of meta-political coalitions in Bonobo communities a very, very long time ago.  These two beliefs are not contradictory, but the complexity lies in reconciling the two.

I suspect, Kurige, you have decided that you have reasons to endorse the quoted belief that God has instilled a sense of right and wrong in us.  And also that you have reasons to endorse the verdict of science.  They both seem like good communities to join, right?  There are benefits to both sets of beliefs?  You introspect and find that you feel good about both beliefs?

But you did not say:

"God instilled a sense of right and wrong in us, and also a sense of morality has been evolutionarily programmed into us.  The two states of reality are not inconsistent, but the complexity lies in reconciling the two."

If you're reading this, Kurige, you should very quickly say the above out loud, so you can notice that it seems at least slightly harder to swallow—notice the subjective difference—before you go to the trouble of rerationalizing.

This is the subjective difference between having reasons to endorse two different beliefs, and your mental model of a single world, a single way-things-are.
