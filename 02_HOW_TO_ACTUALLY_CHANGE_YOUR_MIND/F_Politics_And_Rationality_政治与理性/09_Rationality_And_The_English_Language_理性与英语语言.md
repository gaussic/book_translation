## 理性与英语语言

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

前几天，有人评论说我的写作让他们想起了乔治·奥威尔的《政治与英语语言》。我感到很荣幸。尤其是因为我早就想好了今天要谈的主题。

如果你真的想从艺术家的角度理解理性，那么就去读奥威尔吧；他是理性主义者和作家必读的经典。奥威尔不是科学家，而是一位作家；他的工具不是数字，而是文字；他的对手不是自然，而是人类的邪恶。如果你想让人们在没有审判的情况下被关押多年，你必须用别的方式表达，而不能直说“我要无审判关押詹宁斯先生多年。”你必须让听者的思维变得混乱，阻止他们清晰的想象引发良心的愤怒。你会说：“不可靠分子被送交了另一种司法程序。”

奥威尔愤怒地反对极权主义以及邪恶所依附的模糊思维——这正是他关于语言的著作为什么会成为与费曼、萨根或道金斯等理性主义经典文献齐名的原因。

“作家们被告诫要避免使用被动语态。”如果你是纯科学背景的理性主义者，可能没意识到这句话的问题；但任何稍微写过点东西的人都会立刻看出来。我写的这句话用了被动语态，却没有告诉你是谁告诉作者们要避免被动语态。被动语态去掉了行动者，只留下了被动者。“不可靠分子被送交了另一种司法程序”——被谁送交的？“另一种司法程序”到底做了什么？用足够多的静态名词短语，你可以让任何令人不快的事情看起来没真正发生。

科学期刊文章往往用被动语态写。（抱歉，某些科学家确实用被动语态写期刊文章。文章可不是没人写的，也不是没人该负责。）说“被试者被施用了Progenitorivox”听起来比“我给每个大学生发了一瓶20粒的Progenitorivox，并告诉他们每天晚上服用一粒直到吃完”更有权威感。如果你把科学家从叙述中剔除，剩下的就只有最重要的数据。但实际上科学家在那里，受试者是大学生，Progenitorivox不是“施用”的，而是带着指示交给他们的。被动语态模糊了现实。

根据我收到的评论，肯定有人会反驳说，在期刊文章里用被动语态不算罪过——毕竟，仔细想想，读者能理解科学家就在那儿。这似乎不是逻辑错误。正因为如此，理性主义者需要读奥威尔，不仅仅是读费曼或者杰恩斯。

非虚构传递知识，虚构传递体验。医学科学能推断人在真空中没有保护会发生什么，而虚构能让你亲身体验那种感觉。

有些理性主义者会试图分析一个误导性的表达，看看它是否有任何可能的合理含义，试图构建一个逻辑解释。他们会宽容，给作者以怀疑的好处。反观作家们则受过训练，不会给自己以怀疑的好处。无论观众认为你说了什么，就是你说了什么，不论你是否本意如此；你无法与观众争辩，无论你有多巧妙的辩解。

作家知道读者不会停下来思考。虚构体验是第一印象的连续流。理性作家关注文字所创造的体验。如果你在评估一条理性声明时，故意分析文字，改写命题，尝试不同的含义，寻找真理的闪光点，那么你就丢失了第一印象——观众看到的，或者说感受到的东西。

小说家会立刻感觉到“The subjects were administered Progenitorivox.”这句话的可怕错误。读者如何从中体验生活？这句话制造了一种遥远的权威感，仅此而已——唯一的体验就是被告知某事可靠。小说家会看到太过抽象的名词，无法展现实际发生的事情——拿着药瓶、试图严肃的博士后；听着却带着紧张笑容的学生。

我的意思不是说期刊文章应该写得像小说，而是理性主义者应当有意识地觉察文字创造的体验。理性主义者必须理解心智及其运作方式。这包括意识流，也就是你用语言展开的那部分自我。理性主义者必须有意识地意识到短语的实际体验影响，而不仅仅是它们的命题语义。

或者更直白地说：意义不能为影响开脱！

我不在乎你能为一句像“AI应通过民主程序开发”这样的掌声灯构建出怎样的理性解释。这无法为它唤起观众鼓掌的非理性影响开脱，更不用说其含糊不清的循环论证式模糊表达。

这里是奥威尔，怒斥陈词滥调的影响，以及它们对思维体验的作用：

> 当你看到某个疲惫的骗子在台上机械地重复那些熟悉的词组——野兽般的、暴行、铁蹄、血腥的暴政、世界自由人民、肩并肩站立——你常常会有一种奇怪的感觉，好像你看到的不是一个活生生的人，而是某种假人……使用那种词汇的人已经在某种程度上变成了一台机器。适当的声音从他的喉咙发出，但他的脑子并未参与，就像他在为自己选择词语时的状态……
>
> 最需要的是让意义选择词语，而不是词语支配意义。在散文中，最糟糕的事就是向词语屈服。当你想到一个具体的物体时，你是无言思考的，然后如果想描述你所想象的东西，你可能会四处寻找最贴切的词语。当你想到抽象的东西时，你更倾向于从一开始就用词语，除非你有意识地阻止它，否则现成的方言会涌入替你完成任务，代价是模糊甚至改变你的意义。可能最好尽可能推迟用词，通过画面和感官使你的意义尽量清晰。

这段话很可能是查尔斯·桑德斯·皮尔斯写的。不止一条道路通向大道。

## Rationality and the English Language

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

The other day, someone commented that my writing reminded them of George Orwell’s “Politics and the English Language.”<sup>1</sup> I was honored. Especially since I’d already thought of today’s topic.

If you really want an artist’s perspective on rationality, then read Orwell; he is mandatory reading for rationalists as well as authors. Orwell was not a scientist, but a writer; his tools were not numbers, but words; his adversary was not Nature, but human evil. If you wish to imprison people for years without trial, you must think of some other way to say it than “I’m going to imprison Mr. Jennings for years without trial.” You must muddy the listener’s thinking, prevent clear images from outraging conscience. You say, “Unreliable elements were subjected to an alternative justice process.”

Orwell was the outraged opponent of totalitarianism and the muddy thinking in which evil cloaks itself—which is how Orwell’s writings on language ended up as classic rationalist documents on a level with Feynman, Sagan, or Dawkins.

“Writers are told to avoid usage of the passive voice.” A rationalist whose background comes exclusively from science may fail to see the flaw in the previous sentence; but anyone who’s done a little writing should see it right away. I wrote the sentence in the passive voice, without telling you who tells authors to avoid passive voice. Passive voice removes the actor, leaving only the acted-upon. “Unreliable elements were subjected to an alternative justice process”—subjected by whom? What does an “alternative justice process” do? With enough static noun phrases, you can keep anything unpleasant from actually happening.

Journal articles are often written in passive voice. (Pardon me, some scientists write their journal articles in passive voice. It’s not as if the articles are being written by no one, with no one to blame.) It sounds more authoritative to say “The subjects were administered Progenitorivox” than “I gave each college student a bottle of 20 Progenitorivox, and told them to take one every night until they were gone.” If you remove the scientist from the description, that leaves only the all-important data. But in reality the scientist is there, and the subjects are college students, and the Progenitorivox wasn’t “administered” but handed over with instructions. Passive voice obscures reality.

Judging from the comments I get, someone will protest that using the passive voice in a journal article is hardly a sin—after all, if you think about it, you can realize the scientist is there. It doesn’t seem like a logical flaw. And this is why rationalists need to read Orwell, not just Feynman or even Jaynes.

Nonfiction conveys knowledge, fiction conveys experience. Medical science can extrapolate what would happen to a human unprotected in a vacuum. Fiction can make you live through it.

Some rationalists will try to analyze a misleading phrase, try to see if there might possibly be anything meaningful to it, try to construct a logical interpretation. They will be charitable, give the author the benefit of the doubt. Authors, on the other hand, are trained not to give themselves the benefit of the doubt. Whatever the audience thinks you said is what you said, whether you meant to say it or not; you can’t argue with the audience no matter how clever your justifications.

A writer knows that readers will not stop for a minute to think. A fictional experience is a continuous stream of first impressions. A writer-rationalist pays attention to the experience words create. If you are evaluating the public rationality of a statement, and you analyze the words deliberatively, rephrasing propositions, trying out different meanings, searching for nuggets of truthiness, then you’re losing track of the first impression—what the audience sees, or rather feels.

A novelist would notice the screaming wrongness of “The subjects were administered Progenitorivox.” What life is here for a reader to live? This sentence creates a distant feeling of authoritativeness, and that’s all—the only experience is the feeling of being told something reliable. A novelist would see nouns too abstract to show what actually happened—the postdoc with the bottle in their hand, trying to look stern; the student listening with a nervous grin.

My point is not to say that journal articles should be written like novels, but that a rationalist should become consciously aware of the experiences which words create. A rationalist must understand the mind and how to operate it. That includes the stream of consciousness, the part of yourself that unfolds in language. A rationalist must become consciously aware of the actual, experiential impact of phrases, beyond their mere propositional semantics.<sup>2</sup>

Or to say it more bluntly: Meaning does not excuse impact!

I don’t care what rational interpretation you can construct for an applause light like “AI should be developed through democratic processes.” That cannot excuse its irrational impact of signaling the audience to applaud, not to mention its cloudy question-begging vagueness.

Here is Orwell, railing against the impact of cliches, their effect on the experience of thinking:

> When one watches some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating the familiar phrases—BESTIAL, ATROCITIES, IRON HEEL, BLOODSTAINED TYRANNY, FREE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD, STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER—one often has a curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind of dummy . . . A speaker who uses that kind of phraseology has gone some distance toward turning himself into a machine. The appropriate noises are coming out of his larynx, but his brain is not involved, as it would be if he were choosing his words for himself . . .
> 
> What is above all needed is to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way around. In prose, the worst thing one can do with words is surrender to them. When you think of a concrete object, you think wordlessly, and then, if you want to describe the thing you have been visualising you probably hunt about until you find the exact words that seem to fit it. When you think of something abstract you are more inclined to use words from the start, and unless you make a conscious effort to prevent it, the existing dialect will come rushing in and do the job for you, at the expense of blurring or even changing your meaning. Probably it is better to put off using words as long as possible and get one’s meaning as clear as one can through pictures and sensations.

Charles Sanders Peirce might have written that last paragraph. More than one path can lead to the Way.
