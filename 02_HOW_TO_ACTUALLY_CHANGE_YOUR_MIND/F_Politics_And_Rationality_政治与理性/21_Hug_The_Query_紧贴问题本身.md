## 紧贴问题本身

在理性艺术中，有一种“贴近问题本身”的修炼——尽量观察与原始问题本身最接近的证据，这样可以屏蔽掉尽可能多的其他论据。

莱特兄弟说：“我的飞机能飞。”如果你只看他们的权威（自行车修理工，碰巧又是出色的业余物理学家），你会把他们的权威和比如开尔文勋爵相比，发现开尔文勋爵的权威更高。

如果你要求看莱特兄弟的计算，并且你能看懂，还要求看开尔文勋爵的计算（他大概除了自己的怀疑之外并没有什么计算），那么权威就变得没那么重要了。

如果你真的亲眼看到飞机飞起来，那么对于很多问题来说，计算本身也变得无关紧要，开尔文勋爵的权威更是毫无意义。

你的论据越直接指向问题本身，越少依赖中间推理——在因果大网中，观察节点越接近你关心的节点，证据就越有力。因果图有个定理：你永远无法从远处的节点获得比近处节点更多的信息，只要近处节点已经屏蔽了远处节点的影响。

Jerry Cleaver 说过：“真正让你失败的，不是没用上什么高深复杂的技巧，而是忽略了基本功。没有盯紧目标。”<sup>1</sup>

正如讨论物理本身比讨论资历更高明，讨论物理本身也比讨论理性更高明。莱特兄弟和开尔文勋爵谁更理性？如果我们能检查他们的计算，就根本不用在乎！理性主义者的美德并不能直接让飞机飞起来。

如果你忘了这个原则，学得越多的偏见知识反而会伤害你，因为它会让你忽略更直接的论据。你很容易指责别人犯了你清单上的第182号偏见，但没有更直接的证据，你无法解决事实问题。即使有人有偏见地说“太阳在照耀”，也不会让天变黑。

当然，你并不总能立刻做实验，也并不总能立刻检查计算。<sup>2</sup> 有时你知识储备不够，有时信息是私有的，有时根本没时间。很多时候，判断说话者的理性程度是不得已而为之。可你心里总该有种空落落的感觉，知道自己还缺点什么。

只要有可能，就尽量靠近原始问题本身——紧贴它——靠得足够近，去“拥抱问题”！

## Hug the Query

In the art of rationality there is a discipline of closeness-to-the-issue—trying to observe evidence that is as near to the original question as possible, so that it screens off as many other arguments as possible.

The Wright Brothers say, “My plane will fly.” If you look at their authority (bicycle mechanics who happen to be excellent amateur physicists) then you will compare their authority to, say, Lord Kelvin, and you will find that Lord Kelvin is the greater authority.

If you demand to see the Wright Brothers’ calculations, and you can follow them, and you demand to see Lord Kelvin’s calculations (he probably doesn’t have any apart from his own incredulity), then authority becomes much less relevant.

If you actually watch the plane fly, the calculations themselves become moot for many purposes, and Kelvin’s authority not even worth considering.

The more directly your arguments bear on a question, without intermediate inferences—the closer the observed nodes are to the queried node, in the Great Web of Causality—the more powerful the evidence. It’s a theorem of these causal graphs that you can never get more information from distant nodes, than from strictly closer nodes that screen off the distant ones.

Jerry Cleaver said: “What does you in is not failure to apply some highlevel, intricate, complicated technique. It’s overlooking the basics. Not keeping your eye on the ball.”<sup>1</sup>

Just as it is superior to argue physics than credentials, it is also superior to argue physics than rationality. Who was more rational, the Wright Brothers or Lord Kelvin? If we can check their calculations, we don’t have to care! The virtue of a rationalist cannot directly cause a plane to fly.

If you forget this principle, learning about more biases will hurt you, because it will distract you from more direct arguments. It’s all too easy to argue that someone is exhibiting Bias #182 in your repertoire of fully generic accusations, but you can’t settle a factual issue without closer evidence. If there are biased reasons to say the Sun is shining, that doesn’t make it dark out.

Just as you can’t always experiment today, you can’t always check the calculations today.<sup>1</sup> Sometimes you don’t know enough background material, sometimes there’s private information, sometimes there just isn’t time. There’s a sadly large number of times when it’s worthwhile to judge the speaker’s rationality. You should always do it with a hollow feeling in your heart, though, a sense that something’s missing.

Whenever you can, dance as near to the original question as possible— press yourself up against it—get close enough to hug the query!
