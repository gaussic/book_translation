## 你的敌人天生就是邪恶的吗？

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

我们往往会过于直接地将他人的行为归因于他们的内在性格。我们看到不同寻常的行为时，总是假设是不同寻常的性格使然，而不是去探寻那些现实或想象中的情境，看看是否能解释这种行为。我们会假设对方是“变种人”。

而一旦有人真正冒犯了我们——做了件我们（无论对错）不赞同的事——我观察到，这种归因偏差会加倍严重。我们非常倾向于把恶行归结为敌人那种扭曲、邪恶的天性。这不是从道德角度出发，而是从“先验概率”的角度来看：我们应当先问自己，敌人可能对自身处境有何种认知，从而让他们的行为看起来不那么怪异。这样我们就可以假设一个没那么极端的性格，也就背负了一个较小的“不太可能”的解释负担。

2001年9月11日，十九名穆斯林男性劫持了四架客机，执行了一场故意自杀式的袭击，目标是伤害美国。你觉得他们为什么要这么做？是因为他们把美国看作自由的灯塔，却恰好天生憎恨自由？

现实中，大多数人不会把自己写进一个“我是反派”的人生故事。每个人在自己的故事里，都是主角。敌人在他们自己的视角中，也不会让自己看起来像坏人。如果你硬要揣测一些动机，把敌人描绘成邪恶的化身，那你很可能就会彻底误判敌人的真实心理。

但政治让人变得愚蠢。辩论变成战争，观点成了士兵。如果敌人确实天生邪恶，那这就是支持你这边立场的有力论据。而任何支持己方的论据都必须被捍卫，不管多荒谬——否则你就等于在战场上松了口气。每个人都争先恐后地在爱国式谴责中超越邻人，没人敢唱反调。很快，敌人就长出了犄角、蝙蝠翅膀、喷火的口和滴着腐蚀毒液的尖牙。如果你仅仅是基于事实否认这些特征，那你就是在“为敌人辩护”，你就是叛徒。很少有人能理解你不是在为敌人辩护，而是在捍卫事实。

如果要做出恐怖之举必须是“变种人”，那人类的历史将会截然不同。因为变种人是罕见的。

或者，人们害怕的是“理解”会导致“宽恕”。要杀死一个“邪恶的变种人”要容易得多。喊着“去死吧，恶毒的渣滓！”比喊“去死吧，那些本可能和我一样，只是成长环境不同的人！”要更能激起士气。杀一个并非纯粹邪恶的人，你可能会感到内疚。

在我看来，这反映了人们内心深处一种不切实际的渴望：在政策辩论中，最好的政策居然是毫无代价的。可当一支军队越境，或一个疯子拿着刀冲向你时，你的政策选项只有两个：(a) 自卫，或 (b) 躺下等死。如果你选择自卫，你可能必须杀人。如果你杀的是一个在另一个世界中原本可以成为你朋友的人，那是一个悲剧。而确实，它就是一个悲剧。躺下等死，同样也是一个悲剧。为什么非得有一个“非悲剧”的选项？谁说最优政策一定得没有缺点？如果必须有人死，那最好是先动手的人死，以此震慑后来的暴力，从而减少总体的死亡总量。

如果敌人的性格是普通的，并且他们基于对自身处境的某种信念而采取了暴力行为，而这种信念对他们来说是“人之常情”的回应，这并不意味着他们的信念就是真实的。这也不意味着他们的行为是正当的。这意味着你不得不击倒一个在自己故事中是英雄的人——他们的小说会在第80页让主角死去。这是一个悲剧，但它比另一个悲剧要好。这是每一个警察每天都要做出的选择，为的是维持我们这个小而有序的世界不被混乱吞噬。

当你准确地估计敌人的心理——真正知道敌人内心在想什么时——这种知识不会让你觉得自己狠狠地打击了对方。它不会给你带来义愤填膺的快感。它不会让你感觉良好。如果你的判断让你感到深深的悲哀，那你可能是在看见了世界的真实面貌。更罕见的是，有时一个准确的判断可能会让你感到真正的战栗——比如你面对的是一个真正的精神病患者，或者一个神经系统完好但信仰已经完全摧毁了其理智的人（比如科学教信徒，或那些极端宗教洗脑营的孩子）。

所以我们就直接说出来吧——9/11的劫机者不是邪恶的变种人。他们并不是憎恨自由。他们也把自己当作故事中的英雄，并为了他们认为正义的事业而死——为了“真理、正义和伊斯兰的道路”。他们是这么看待自己的，并不意味着他们的信念就是真理。这也不意味着我们必须认为他们的行为是正当的。这也不意味着93号航班的乘客就应该袖手旁观，任由事情发生。但这确实意味着，在另一个世界里，如果他们成长于不同的环境，那些劫机者也可能会成为警察。这确实是一个悲剧。

欢迎来到地球。

## Are Your Enemies Innately Evil?

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

We see far too direct a correspondence between others’ actions and their inherent dispositions. We see unusual dispositions that exactly match the unusual behavior, rather than asking after real situations or imagined situations that could explain the behavior. We hypothesize mutants.

When someone actually offends us—commits an action of which we (rightly or wrongly) disapprove—then, I observe, the correspondence bias redoubles. There seems to be a very strong tendency to blame evil deeds on the Enemy’s mutant, evil disposition. Not as a moral point, but as a strict question of prior probability, we should ask what the Enemy might believe about their situation that would reduce the seeming bizarrity of their behavior. This would allow us to hypothesize a less exceptional disposition, and thereby shoulder a lesser burden of improbability.

On September 11th, 2001, nineteen Muslim males hijacked four jet airliners in a deliberately suicidal effort to hurt the United States of America. Now why do you suppose they might have done that? Because they saw the USA as a beacon of freedom to the world, but were born with a mutant disposition that made them hate freedom?

Realistically, most people don’t construct their life stories with themselves as the villains. Everyone is the hero of their own story. The Enemy’s story, as seen by the Enemy, is not going to make the Enemy look bad. If you try to construe motivations that would make the Enemy look bad, you’ll end up flat wrong about what actually goes on in the Enemy’s mind.

But politics is the mind-killer. Debate is war; arguments are soldiers. If the Enemy did have an evil disposition, that would be an argument in favor of your side. And any argument that favors your side must be supported, no matter how silly—otherwise you’re letting up the pressure somewhere on the battlefront. Everyone strives to outshine their neighbor in patriotic denunciation, and no one dares to contradict. Soon the Enemy has horns, bat wings, flaming breath, and fangs that drip corrosive venom. If you deny any aspect of this on merely factual grounds, you are arguing the Enemy’s side; you are a traitor. Very few people will understand that you aren’t defending the Enemy, just defending the truth.

If it took a mutant to do monstrous things, the history of the human species would look very different. Mutants would be rare.

Or maybe the fear is that understanding will lead to forgiveness. It’s easier to shoot down evil mutants. It is a more inspiring battle cry to scream, “Die, vicious scum!” instead of “Die, people who could have been just like me but grew up in a different environment!” You might feel guilty killing people who weren’t pure darkness.

This looks to me like the deep-seated yearning for a one-sided policy debate in which the best policy has no drawbacks. If an army is crossing the border or a lunatic is coming at you with a knife, the policy alternatives are (a) defend yourself or (b) lie down and die. If you defend yourself, you may have to kill. If you kill someone who could, in another world, have been your friend, that is a tragedy. And it is a tragedy. The other option, lying down and dying, is also a tragedy. Why must there be a non-tragic option? Who says that the best policy available must have no downside? If someone has to die, it may as well be the initiator of force, to discourage future violence and thereby minimize the total sum of death.

If the Enemy has an average disposition, and is acting from beliefs about their situation that would make violence a typically human response, then that doesn’t mean their beliefs are factually accurate. It doesn’t mean they’re justified. It means you’ll have to shoot down someone who is the hero of their own story, and in their novel the protagonist will die on page 80. That is a tragedy, but it is better than the alternative tragedy. It is the choice that every police officer makes, every day, to keep our neat little worlds from dissolving into chaos.

When you accurately estimate the Enemy’s psychology—when you know what is really in the Enemy’s mind—that knowledge won’t feel like landing a delicious punch on the opposing side. It won’t give you a warm feeling of righteous indignation. It won’t make you feel good about yourself. If your estimate makes you feel unbearably sad, you may be seeing the world as it really is. More rarely, an accurate estimate may send shivers of serious horror down your spine, as when dealing with true psychopaths, or neurologically intact people with beliefs that have utterly destroyed their sanity (Scientologists or Jesus Campers).

So let’s come right out and say it—the 9/11 hijackers weren’t evil mutants. They did not hate freedom. They, too, were the heroes of their own stories, and they died for what they believed was right—truth, justice, and the Islamic way. If the hijackers saw themselves that way, it doesn’t mean their beliefs were true. If the hijackers saw themselves that way, it doesn’t mean that we have to agree that what they did was justified. If the hijackers saw themselves that way, it doesn’t mean that the passengers of United Flight 93 should have stood aside and let it happen. It does mean that in another world, if they had been raised in a different environment, those hijackers might have been police officers. And that is indeed a tragedy. Welcome to Earth.
