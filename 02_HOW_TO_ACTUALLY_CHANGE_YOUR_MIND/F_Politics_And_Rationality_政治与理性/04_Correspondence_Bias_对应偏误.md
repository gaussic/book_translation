我们往往过于直接地将他人的行为与其人格特质对应起来。比如当我们看到别人莫名其妙地踢了一台自动售货机，我们会认为那个人是个“脾气暴躁的人”。但如果是你自己踢了售货机，那是因为你等的公交车迟到了，地铁又来得太早，你的报告还没写完，而这台该死的售货机已经连续第二天吞了你的午餐钱。你心里想的是：**在这种情况下，谁不会踢那台售货机？**

我们将自己的行为归因于所处的情境，认为这些行为是对当下环境的正常反应。但当别人踢售货机时，我们看不到对方背后的生活经历，只看到一脚踢出，毫无我们能感知的理由，于是便认为这个人是个天生暴躁的家伙——毕竟他毫无缘由地发了火。

然而，考虑一下概率问题：这个世界上公交车迟到的情况，远比“天生愤怒基因变异导致随机踢售货机”的人数多得多。尽管事实上，每个人平均带有两到十个表现出来的体细胞突变，但任何一个特定位点的基因发生突变的概率其实很低。一个人某方面的性格特质非常偏离平均水平的可能性，也很小。认为某人天生有踢售货机的倾向，是一种不太可能的假设。

即使我们明知道行为背后有情境因素，人们依然很难摆脱对行为的过度解释。当受试者被明确告知某个支持堕胎或反对堕胎的发言者是被**随机指派**去发表那个立场的演讲时，他们**仍然**会认为这个发言者本人有相应的倾向。<sup>2</sup>

直觉上，我们倾向于用“水灵”来解释下雨，用“火质（phlogiston）”解释燃烧，用“催眠因子”解释药物的安眠效果。现实的机制通常要复杂得多：下雨源于蒸发与冷凝循环，燃烧基于氧化反应，安眠药则是通过化学物质与神经系统相互作用来产生效果。但机制听起来比“本质”更复杂、更难理解、不那么易于获得。所以当看到有人踢售货机时，我们就会想：“他大概有种天生的踢售货机倾向。”

除非这个人是我们自己——这种情况下我们会觉得自己的行为完全合情合理，换做别人也会这么做。事实上，我们还会**高估别人跟我们做出相同行为的可能性**，这就是所谓的“虚假共识效应”（false consensus effect）。喝酒的学生会高估其他学生也喝酒的比例，而不喝酒的学生则会低估。

“基本归因错误”（fundamental attribution error）指的是我们倾向于将他人的行为过多归因于其人格特质，而对自己则倾向于归因于情境。

若想理解人们为何如此行事，首先要意识到每个人都认为自己行为正常。不要急于揣测他们是否天生有某种奇怪的性格缺陷，去解释他们的行为；而要问，他们认为自己身处于怎样的情境。是的，人确实有一定的性格特质，但这种遗传性的性格差异，并不足以解释你观察到的所有行为。

假设我给你一个有两个按钮的装置：一个红色按钮能毁灭世界，一个绿色按钮可以阻止红色按钮被按下。你会按哪个？当然是绿色的。任何回答红色的人，大概是把问题想复杂了。<sup>3</sup>

然而，人们有时候还会问我，为什么我想要拯救世界。<sup>4</sup>好像我一定是有个创伤童年之类的理由。但如果你是以这样的方式看待问题，拯救世界其实是一个非常显而易见的决定……

也许我确实有一些非主流的观点，值得去探究为什么我会这么想（毕竟大多数人不是这样想的）。但如果你接受了这些观点，那么我的行为就不再需要额外的解释。或许我陷入了虚假共识，或许我高估了别人如果也这样看问题，会做出相同行为的可能性。但我想，至少会有**相当一部分人**按下绿色按钮。

从内心看，大多数人都觉得自己再正常不过了。即便是你讨厌的人，做了可怕事情的人，也不是某种异常的变异体。不幸的是，这些行为其实**并不需要变异来解释**。理解这一点，你就准备好不再对人类行为感到惊讶了。

## Correspondence Bias

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

> The correspondence bias is the tendency to draw inferences about a person’s unique and enduring dispositions from behaviors that can be entirely explained by the situations in which they occur.
> 
> —Gilbert and Malone<sup>1</sup>

We tend to see far too direct a correspondence between others’ actions and personalities. When we see someone else kick a vending machine for no visible reason, we assume they are “an angry person.” But when you yourself kick the vending machine, it’s because the bus was late, the train was early, your report is overdue, and now the damned vending machine has eaten your lunch money for the second day in a row. Surely, you think to yourself, _anyone would kick the vending machine, in that situation._

We attribute our own actions to our situations, seeing our behaviors as perfectly normal responses to experience. But when someone else kicks a vending machine, we don’t see their past history trailing behind them in the air. We just see the kick, for no reason we know about, and we think this must be a naturally angry person—since they lashed out without any provocation.

Yet consider the prior probabilities. There are more late buses in the world, than mutants born with unnaturally high anger levels that cause them to sometimes spontaneously kick vending machines. Now the average human is, in fact, a mutant. If I recall correctly, an average individual has two to ten somatically expressed mutations. But any given DNA location is very unlikely to be affected. Similarly, any given aspect of someone’s disposition is probably not very far from average. To suggest otherwise is to shoulder a burden of improbability.

Even when people are informed explicitly of situational causes, they don’t seem to properly discount the observed behavior. When subjects are told that a pro-abortion or anti-abortion speaker was randomly assigned to give a speech on that position, subjects still think the speakers harbor leanings in the direction randomly assigned.<sup>2</sup>

It seems quite intuitive to explain rain by water spirits; explain fire by a fire-stuff (phlogiston) escaping from burning matter; explain the soporific effect of a medication by saying that it contains a “dormitive potency.” Reality usually involves more complicated mechanisms: an evaporation and condensation cycle underlying rain, oxidizing combustion underlying fire, chemical interactions with the nervous system for soporifics. But mechanisms sound more complicated than essences; they are harder to think of, less available. So when someone kicks a vending machine, we think they have an innate vending-machine-kicking-tendency.

Unless the “someone” who kicks the machine is us—in which case we’re behaving perfectly normally, given our situations; surely anyone else would do the same. Indeed, we overestimate how likely others are to respond the same way we do—the “false consensus effect.” Drinking students considerably overestimate the fraction of fellow students who drink, but nondrinkers considerably underestimate the fraction. The “fundamental attribution error” refers to our tendency to overattribute others’ behaviors to their dispositions, while reversing this tendency for ourselves.

To understand why people act the way they do, we must first realize that everyone sees themselves as behaving normally. Don’t ask what strange, mutant disposition they were born with, which directly corresponds to their surface behavior. Rather, ask what situations people see themselves as being in. Yes, people do have dispositions—but there are not enough heritable quirks of disposition to directly account for all the surface behaviors you see.

Suppose I gave you a control with two buttons, a red button and a green button. The red button destroys the world, and the green button stops the red button from being pressed. Which button would you press? The green one. Anyone who gives a different answer is probably overcomplicating the question.<sup>3</sup>

And yet people sometimes ask me why I want to save the world.<sup>4</sup> Like I must have had a traumatic childhood or something. Really, it seems like a pretty obvious decision . . . if you see the situation in those terms.

I may have non-average views which call for explanation—why do I believe such things, when most people don’t?—but given those beliefs, my reaction doesn’t seem to call forth an exceptional explanation. Perhaps I am a victim of false consensus; perhaps I overestimate how many people would press the green button if they saw the situation in those terms. But y’know, I’d still bet there’d be at least a substantial minority.

Most people see themselves as perfectly normal, from the inside. Even people you hate, people who do terrible things, are not exceptional mutants. No mutations are required, alas. When you understand this, you are ready to stop being surprised by human events.
