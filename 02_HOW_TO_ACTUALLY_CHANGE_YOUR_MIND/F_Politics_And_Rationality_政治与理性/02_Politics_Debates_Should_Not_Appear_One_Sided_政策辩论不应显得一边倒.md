## 政策辩论不应显得一边倒

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

Robin Hanson 提议设立商店专门出售被禁产品。<sup>1</sup>这种政策确实有很多很有力的理由支持——个体自由的基本权利、官僚出于职业激励倾向于禁止一切、立法者也和普通人一样有偏见。但即便如此（我回应说），仍会有一些贫穷、诚实、受教育程度不高的五个孩子的母亲走进这些商店，买一瓶“蛇油博士的硫酸饮料”来治疗她的关节炎，结果死去，留下一群孩子在国家电视台上哭泣。

我只是在陈述一个事实。为什么有人会认为这是支持监管的论据呢？

在涉及简单事实的问题上（比如地球上的生命是否通过自然选择演化而来），我们确实有理由期待论据应该是一边倒的——事实本身只能是对或错，而所谓的“证据平衡”也应反映出这一点。实际上，在贝叶斯证据定义中，“强有力的证据”指的正是那种我们只会在争论的一方发现的证据。

但对于那些复杂行为、拥有众多后果的政策选择，就没有理由期待这种一边倒的性质了。那为什么人们似乎总是希望政策辩论也是一边倒的呢？

**政治是思维的毒药。** 论据就像士兵。一旦你知道自己站在哪一方，你就必须支持该方的所有论点，并攻击所有看似支持对方的论点；否则你就像是在背刺自己的士兵。如果你陷入这种模式，政策辩论在你看来也会是单边的——你支持的政策的成本和缺点变成了敌方士兵，必须被尽一切手段击败。

你还应该意识到一种相关的错误模式：认为“深刻智慧”的体现是对占据最多话语权的两种政策立场平均妥协。一个政策确实可能具有明显不对称的成本或收益。如果所有政策问题都刚好平衡，我们就根本没法对它们做出决策。但人类往往会否认自己偏爱的政策的成本，或者否认不喜欢的政策的任何好处；因此人们往往会认为政策权衡比实际情况更加倾斜。

如果你允许开设出售被禁产品的商店，就会有一些贫穷、诚实、教育程度低的五个孩子的母亲买到会致命的产品。这是对一个客观后果的预测，作为一个事实问题，它其实很直接——理智的人无论支持哪种政策立场，都应该坦率地承认这一点。你当然也可以认为禁令只会推高价格，认为监管者会滥用权力，或认为她的个人自由比你插手她生活的愿望更重要。但**作为一个简单的事实，她还是会死。**

我们生活在一个不公平的宇宙中。像所有灵长类动物一样，人类对感知到的不公平有强烈的负面反应；因此我们会对这个事实感到痛苦。而面对由此带来的**认知失调**，人们有两种常见的应对方式：第一，改变对事实的看法——否认这些不公平事件发生过，或篡改历史使其看起来更公平；<sup>2</sup> 第二，改变自己的道德观——否认这些事件是“不公平”的。

有些自由意志主义者可能会说：如果你走进“被禁品商店”，无视门口写着“本店商品可能致死”的警告标志，最后买到某种致命的东西，那就是你自找的，活该。如果这是一个道德真理，那开设这些商店就没有任何缺点。那不仅是一个净收益的问题，更是一个**毫无成本的单边选择**。

也有人认为，监管者可以被训练得理性而能与消费者利益保持一致；如果这是事实，那么（在他们的道德体系中）监管也就没有缺点。

不管你愿不愿意接受，**智力存在先天的出生彩票**——尽管这个宇宙的不公平性如此极端，以至于很多人选择否认这一事实。关于智力遗传影响系数在 0.6–0.8 之间的实验证据压倒性地成立；但即使否认这一点，人们也无法选择自己的家庭环境或早期教育。

我从小被教导：**否认现实是一种道德错误。** 如果我对“硫酸饮料”可能对我有好处心存侥幸，那我就是在做一件我从小被告诫不该做的事情。有些人出生在这样的环境中（我们就不谈基因了，因为那太不公平），他们周围的巫医告诉他们：有信仰是对的，怀疑是错的。他们出于善意，听从了这些建议，最终死去。不同于你，他们并未从小被教导“人应该对自己跟从社会引导的选择负责”。你真的觉得，自己聪明到就算出生在公元 500 年也能成为一个合格的科学怀疑论者？**是的，出生彩票确实存在——无论你对基因的看法如何。**

说“买危险产品的人活该受伤！”并不是冷静理智的表现。那只是一种**拒绝承认宇宙不公平**的方式。真正冷静理智的态度应该是：“是的，硫酸导致的是一种极其痛苦的死亡，是的，那位五个孩子的母亲不应该死，但我们仍决定允许这些商店营业，因为我们做过成本收益分析。”你能想象哪位政治家会说这种话吗？我也不能。但在经济学家多少还能影响政策的地方，哪怕他们只能私下这样想——甚至在期刊文章里委婉地、用多音节术语写出来，让媒体无法引用——也可能有所帮助。

我并不认为，当某人做了一个愚蠢的选择然后死了，这就值得庆祝。我把这当成一个悲剧。拯救人并不总是意味着要保护他们免于自作自受的后果；但我会在**死刑**这件事上划一道道德底线。如果你死了，你就**无法再从错误中学习。**

不幸的是，宇宙并不认同我的看法。我们拭目以待，看看最后谁还能站着。

## Policy Debates Should Not Appear One-Sided

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Robin Hanson proposed stores where banned products could be sold.<sup>1</sup> There are a number of excellent arguments for such a policy—an inherent right of individual liberty, the career incentive of bureaucrats to prohibit everything, legislators being just as biased as individuals. But even so (I replied), some poor, honest, not overwhelmingly educated mother of five children is going to go into these stores and buy a “Dr. Snakeoil’s Sulfuric Acid Drink” for her arthritis and die, leaving her orphans to weep on national television.

I was just making a factual observation. Why did some people think it was an argument in favor of regulation?

On questions of simple fact (for example, whether Earthly life arose by natural selection) there’s a legitimate expectation that the argument should be a one-sided battle; the facts themselves are either one way or another, and the so-called “balance of evidence” should reflect this. Indeed, under the Bayesian definition of evidence, “strong evidence” is just that sort of evidence which we only expect to find on one side of an argument.

But there is no reason for complex actions with many consequences to exhibit this onesidedness property. Why do people seem to want their policy debates to be one-sided?

Politics is the mind-killer. Arguments are soldiers. Once you know which side you’re on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it’s like stabbing your soldiers in the back. If you abide within that pattern, policy debates will also appear one-sided to you—the costs and drawbacks of your favored policy are enemy soldiers, to be attacked by any means necessary.

One should also be aware of a related failure pattern: thinking that the course of Deep Wisdom is to compromise with perfect evenness between whichever two policy positions receive the most airtime. A policy may legitimately have lopsided costs or benefits. If policy questions were not tilted one way or the other, we would be unable to make decisions about them. But there is also a human tendency to deny all costs of a favored policy, or deny all benefits of a disfavored policy; and people will therefore tend to think policy tradeoffs are tilted much further than they actually are.

If you allow shops that sell otherwise banned products, some poor, honest, poorly educated mother of five kids is going to buy something that kills her. This is a prediction about a factual consequence, and as a factual question it appears rather straightforward—a sane person should readily confess this to be true regardless of which stance they take on the policy issue. You may also think that making things illegal just makes them more expensive, that regulators will abuse their power, or that her individual freedom trumps your desire to meddle with her life. But, as a matter of simple fact, she’s still going to die.

We live in an unfair universe. Like all primates, humans have strong negative reactions to perceived unfairness; thus we find this fact stressful. There are two popular methods of dealing with the resulting cognitive dissonance. First, one may change one’s view of the facts—deny that the unfair events took place, or edit the history to make it appear fair.<sup>2</sup> Second, one may change one’s morality—deny that the events are unfair.

Some libertarians might say that if you go into a “banned products shop,” passing clear warning labels that say THINGS IN THIS STORE MAY KILL YOU, and buy something that kills you, then it’s your own fault and you deserve it. If that were a moral truth, there would be no downside to having shops that sell banned products. It wouldn’t just be a net benefit, it would be a one-sided tradeoff with no drawbacks.

Others argue that regulators can be trained to choose rationally and in harmony with consumer interests; if those were the facts of the matter then (in their moral view) there would be no downside to regulation.

Like it or not, there’s a birth lottery for intelligence—though this is one of the cases where the universe’s unfairness is so extreme that many people choose to deny the facts. The experimental evidence for a purely genetic component of 0.6–0.8 is overwhelming, but even if this were to be denied, you don’t choose your parental upbringing or your early schools either.

I was raised to believe that denying reality is a moral wrong. If I were to engage in wishful optimism about how Sulfuric Acid Drink was likely to benefit me, I would be doing something that I was warned against and raised to regard as unacceptable. Some people are born into environments—we won’t discuss their genes, because that part is too unfair—where the local witch doctor tells them that it is right to have faith and wrong to be skeptical. In all goodwill, they follow this advice and die. Unlike you, they weren’t raised to believe that people are responsible for their individual choices to follow society’s lead. Do you really think you’re so smart that you would have been a proper scientific skeptic even if you’d been born in 500 CE? Yes, there is a birth lottery, no matter what you believe about genes.

Saying “People who buy dangerous products deserve to get hurt!” is not tough-minded. It is a way of refusing to live in an unfair universe. Real tough-mindedness is saying, “Yes, sulfuric acid is a horrible painful death, and no, that mother of five children didn’t deserve it, but we’re going to keep the shops open anyway because we did this cost-benefit calculation.” Can you imagine a politician saying that? Neither can I. But insofar as economists have the power to influence policy, it might help if they could think it privately—maybe even say it in journal articles, suitably dressed up in polysyllabismic obfuscationalization so the media can’t quote it.

I don’t think that when someone makes a stupid choice and dies, this is a cause for celebration. I count it as a tragedy. It is not always helping people, to save them from the consequences of their own actions; but I draw a moral line at capital punishment. If you’re dead, you can’t learn from your mistakes.

Unfortunately the universe doesn’t agree with me. We’ll see which one of us is still standing when this is over.
