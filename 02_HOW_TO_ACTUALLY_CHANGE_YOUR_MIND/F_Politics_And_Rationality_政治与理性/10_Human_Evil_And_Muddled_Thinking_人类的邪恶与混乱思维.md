## 人类的邪恶与混乱思维

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

乔治·奥威尔目睹了文明世界沦为极权主义的过程，一个又一个国家被吞噬或腐化；那只永远踩在人脸上的皮靴——请记住，那是**永远**的。你出生得太晚，无法记得那个极权主义似乎势不可挡的时代：一个又一个国家落入秘密警察和午夜敲门声的统治之下，而自由大学的教授们却把苏联的大清洗当作“进步”来颂扬。对你来说，这一切仿佛是虚构小说，很难当真。因为在你的这条时间线上，柏林墙已经倒塌了。如果奥威尔的名字没有刻在那堵墙上的某块石头上，那实在是种遗憾。

奥威尔看到了人类的命运，并拼尽全力将其从原路上拉离。他的武器就是清晰的写作。奥威尔深知：混乱的语言就是混乱的思维；他知道，人类的邪恶与混乱的思维如同DNA的互补链一样纠缠在一起。<sup>1</sup>

> 在我们这个时代，政治言论和写作大多是为了辩护那些不可辩护之事。像英国继续统治印度、苏联的大清洗与驱逐、对日本投下原子弹等等，这些确实**可以**被辩护，但只能用大多数人无法面对、且与政治党派公开目标完全不符的残酷论据来辩护。因此，政治语言主要由委婉语、乞题论证和纯粹朦胧的模糊性构成。无防卫能力的村庄被空袭，居民被驱赶到乡下，牛群被机枪扫射，茅屋被燃烧弹点燃：这一切被称为“**平定行动**”……

奥威尔对他追求语言清晰的目标十分明确：

> 如果你简化你的英语表达，你就能摆脱最荒谬的正统观念。你将无法说出那些“必要的”政治方言，而当你说出愚蠢的话时，它的愚蠢性将变得显而易见，甚至你自己也能看出来。

让我们的愚蠢连我们自己都能清楚地看到——这正是“**克服偏见**”的核心。

邪恶在黑暗的心灵角落里潜行、隐藏。我们带着历史的清晰回望，为斯大林和毛策划的大饥荒而哭泣——那场灾难夺去了数千万人的生命。我们称之为“邪恶”，因为这是一种**蓄意制造痛苦与死亡**的行为，是对无辜者的有意加害。我们之所以称它为“邪恶”，是因为我们用历史的清晰眼光回顾时，会产生由衷的厌恶感。为了让邪恶避免自然产生的反对力量，这种厌恶感必须被压抑、保持潜伏。必须**不惜一切代价**避免清晰。正如眼光清明之人倾向于反对他们所看到的邪恶，邪恶本身也总是在尽力让人思维混乱。

《1984》把这一点表现得淋漓尽致：奥威尔笔下的终极反派是负责剪裁与修饰照片的人（灵感源自苏联真实存在的删改历史）。在“爱之部”最黑暗的深处，奥布莱恩折磨温斯顿，让他承认“二加二等于五”：<sup>2</sup>

> “你还记得，”他继续说，“你曾在日记中写道：‘自由，就是说出二加二等于四的自由’吗？”
>
> “记得。”温斯顿说。
>
> 奥布莱恩举起左手，手背朝外，拇指藏住，只伸出四根手指。
>
> “我举起了几根手指，温斯顿？”
>
> “四根。”
>
> “那如果党说不是四根，而是五根呢——那你说是几根？”
>
> “四根。”

> 这个词最后伴随着一声痛苦的喘息而结束。指针猛地跳到了五十五，温斯顿汗如雨下，空气强行挤入他的肺中，又带着深沉的呻吟被吐出，他即使咬紧牙关也无法遏制。奥布莱恩注视着他，四根手指依旧伸着。他拉回杠杆，这次疼痛稍微减轻了一些。

我常常对一些**貌似聪明**的人感到震惊——比如罗宾·汉森的同事泰勒·柯文（Tyler Cowen）——他们竟然觉得“克服偏见”并不重要。<sup>3</sup> 我们说的是**你的思维**，**你的人类智慧**！那是你和猩猩的分界线！那是人类建造整个世界的根基！你居然觉得，心智的运行方式不重要？你觉得，大脑的系统性失误不重要？你觉得，如果所有人都是理想的贝叶斯推理者，宗教裁判所还会去拷打“女巫”吗？

泰勒·柯文显然觉得“克服偏见”跟“偏见本身”一样有偏见：“我认为罗宾的博客本身就是偏见的体现，而且实际上说明了偏见是很有用的。”我希望这只是他想装聪明、过度抽象化思考的结果。他难道真的觉得，对人命价值的范围不敏感，和那些**真心想制定拯救最多人性命计划**的人是在一个层级上的吗？

奥威尔也曾被迫与一种相似的观点斗争——承认区分标准就是幼稚：

> 斯图尔特·蔡斯（Stuart Chase）等人几乎声称**所有抽象词汇都是无意义的**，并以此为借口提倡一种政治静默主义。既然你都不知道什么是法西斯主义，那你又如何反对它？

也许“克服偏见”听起来不够惊心动魄，毕竟它常被描绘成对“无心之过”的斗争。也许，如果没有一个**明确的邪恶对象**来反对，它确实更难让人热血沸腾。那么，就让我们说得**再清楚不过**：世界上所有的人类邪恶、所有的残酷、所有的酷刑、所有的蓄意谋杀，**背后都笼罩着偏见**。而当清晰眼光之人揭露偏见，那些被隐藏的邪恶就会反击。真相确实有敌人。如果《克服偏见》是苏联时期的一份通讯刊物，它的每一位作者与评论者都会被送去劳改营。

在人类的整个历史中，每一次伟大的进步，都是由**思维清晰的突破**所驱动。除了少数自然灾难之外，每一次巨大的灾难，都源自某种**愚蠢**。我们的终极敌人是我们自己；这是一场战争，而我们，便是士兵。

## Human Evil and Muddled Thinking

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

George Orwell saw the descent of the civilized world into totalitarianism, the conversion or corruption of one country after another; the boot stamping on a human face, forever, and remember that it is forever. You were born too late to remember a time when the rise of totalitarianism seemed unstoppable, when one country after another fell to secret police and the thunderous knock at midnight, while the professors of free universities hailed the Soviet Union’s purges as progress. It feels as alien to you as fiction; it is hard for you to take seriously. Because, in your branch of time, the Berlin Wall fell. And if Orwell’s name is not carved into one of those stones, it should be.

Orwell saw the destiny of the human species, and he put forth a convulsive effort to wrench it off its path. Orwell’s weapon was clear writing. Orwell knew that muddled language is muddled thinking; he knew that human evil and muddled thinking intertwine like conjugate strands of DNA:<sup>1</sup>

> In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of the political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenceless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called PACIFICATION . . .

Orwell was clear on the goal of his clarity:

> If you simplify your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy. You cannot speak any of the necessary dialects, and when you make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself.

To make our stupidity obvious, even to ourselves—this is the heart of Overcoming Bias.

Evil sneaks, hidden, through the unlit shadows of the mind. We look back with the clarity of history, and weep to remember the planned famines of Stalin and Mao, which killed tens of millions. We call this evil, because it was done by deliberate human intent to inflict pain and death upon innocent human beings. We call this evil, because of the revulsion that we feel against it, looking back with the clarity of history. For perpetrators of evil to avoid its natural opposition, the revulsion must remain latent. Clarity must be avoided at any cost. Even as humans of clear sight tend to oppose the evil that they see; so too does human evil, wherever it exists, set out to muddle thinking.

1984 sets this forth starkly: Orwell’s ultimate villains are cutters and airbrushers of photographs (based on historical cutting and airbrushing in the Soviet Union). At the peak of all darkness in the Ministry of Love, O’Brien tortures Winston to admit that two plus two equals five:<sup>2</sup>

> “Do you remember,” he went on, “writing in your diary, ‘Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four’?”
> 
> “Yes,” said Winston.
> 
> O’Brien held up his left hand, its back towards Winston, with the thumb hidden and the four fingers extended.
> 
> “How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?”
> 
> “Four.”
> 
> “And if the party says that it is not four but five—then how many?”
> 
> “Four.”

> The word ended in a gasp of pain. The needle of the dial had shot up to fifty-five. The sweat had sprung out all over Winston’s body. The air tore into his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching his teeth he could not stop. O’Brien watched him, the four fingers still extended. He drew back the lever. This time the pain was only slightly eased.

I am continually aghast at apparently intelligent folks—such as Robin Hanson’s colleague Tyler Cowen—who don’t think that overcoming bias is important.<sup>3</sup> This is your mind we’re talking about. Your human intelligence. It separates you from an orangutan. It built this world. You don’t think how the mind works is important? You don’t think the mind’s systematic malfunctions are important? Do you think the Inquisition would have tortured witches, if all were ideal Bayesians?

Tyler Cowen apparently feels that overcoming bias is just as biased as bias: “I view Robin’s blog as exemplifying bias, and indeed showing that bias can be very useful.” I hope this is only the result of thinking too abstractly while trying to sound clever. Does Tyler seriously think that scope insensitivity to the value of human life is on the same level with trying to create plans that will really save as many lives as possible?

Orwell was forced to fight a similar attitude—that to admit to any distinction is youthful naiveté:

> Stuart Chase and others have come near to claiming that all abstract words are meaningless, and have used this as a pretext for advocating a kind of political quietism. Since you don’t know what Fascism is, how can you struggle against Fascism?

Maybe overcoming bias doesn’t look quite exciting enough, if it’s framed as a struggle against mere accidental mistakes. Maybe it’s harder to get excited if there isn’t some clear evil to oppose. So let us be absolutely clear that where there is human evil in the world, where there is cruelty and torture and deliberate murder, there are biases enshrouding it. Where people of clear sight oppose these biases, the concealed evil fights back. The truth does have enemies. If Overcoming Bias were a newsletter in the old Soviet Union, every poster and commenter of Overcoming Bias would have been shipped off to labor camps.

In all human history, every great leap forward has been driven by a new clarity of thought. Except for a few natural catastrophes, every great woe has been driven by a stupidity. Our last enemy is ourselves; and this is a war, and we are soldiers.
