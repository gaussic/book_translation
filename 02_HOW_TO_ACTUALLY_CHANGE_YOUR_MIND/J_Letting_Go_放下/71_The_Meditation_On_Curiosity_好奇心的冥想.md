## 好奇心的冥想

第一美德是好奇心。  
——《理性的十二美德》

作为理性主义者，我们有义务批判自己、质疑自己的信念……不是吗？

想象一下，如果你一开始就对自己说：“批判自己的信念是我的责任”，在心理层面会发生什么。Roger Zelazny 曾区分过“想成为作家”和“想写作”的区别。马克·吐温说：“经典就是每个人都想读过，但没人想去读的东西。”如果你是出于责任感来批判自己，你只是想“调查过”，这样事后就能说自己的信仰不是盲信。这和真正想要调查并不一样。

这种心态会导致你在调查时“有动力地停止”。你会考虑一个反对意见，然后再给出一个反驳，接着就停下了。你会对几个反对意见都这样做，直到你觉得自己已经尽到了调查的责任，然后就此打住。你实现了内在的心理目标：消除那种“自认为是理性主义者却又知道自己没批判过信念”的认知失调。你可以把这叫做“理性主义满足感的购买”——试图获得一种“责任已尽”的温暖满足感。

之后，你给出的概率水平会足够高，可以为你维持原有计划和信念提供理由，但又不会高到让自己或其他理性主义者觉得难以置信。

当你真的好奇时，你会倾向于选择那些最有可能改变信念的调查，或者选择那些和你以前尝试过的最不一样的调查。调查结束后，你的概率分布很可能不会和一开始一样——应该会发生变化，无论是上升还是下降；如果你真的好奇，两个方向你都能接受。

这和潜意识里想让调查停留在熟悉领域、好让你尽快完成调查、恢复原有计划和信念的平衡，是完全不同的。

至于我认为真正的好奇心应该是什么样、它拥有怎样的力量，我推荐你去看本系列第一本《地图与领地》中的《科学与政治的寓言》。那个寓言展示了不同角色面对惊人发现时的反应，每个人的反应都用来说明不同的道理。最后一个角色 Ferris 体现了天真好奇心的力量：那是一种轻盈和对证据的热切追寻。

Ursula K. LeGuin 写道：“天真本身无法抵御邪恶，但它却能成就善良。”<sup>1</sup> 天真的好奇心也可能天真地走偏；所以理性主义者的训练和随之而来的复杂性，必须勇敢面对这种危险，才能变得更强大。但我们仍然可以努力保留那份轻盈和热切。

正如《理性的十二美德》中所写：

> 如果你内心相信自己已经知道，或者你内心并不想知道，那么你的提问就会失去意义，你的技能也会失去方向。好奇心渴望自我消灭；没有哪种好奇心不想得到答案。

真正的好奇心没有替代品。对知识的强烈渴望，比起对追求真理的庄严誓言更有力量。但你无法仅凭意志产生好奇心，就像你不能靠意志让冷脚变暖一样。有时候，我们只有那份庄严的誓言。

那么，责任感能做什么？首先，我们可以努力让自己对“责任调查”产生兴趣——密切关注那些真正让你好奇、甚至让你感到无知并渴望解决的火花。这也包括特别留意那些让你感到痛苦、你本能回避的可能性——这并不全是负面思考。

冥想“期望证据守恒”也很有帮助。每当你提出一个新问题、看到一条新证据时，期望后的概率应该等于你之前的概率。在调查的微观过程中，你的信念应该始终准备好向任意方向变化。不是每个证据都能让信念从70%一下子变成30%，但如果你当前信念是70%，你应该同样准备好降到69%或升到71%。你不应该觉得自己知道（平均而言）会往哪个方向变，因为按概率论的规律，如果你知道终点，你其实已经在那里了。如果你能诚实地调查，让每个新证据都真正有同等可能让信念上升或下降，这会帮助你对调查过程本身保持兴趣，甚至激发好奇心。

如果你正在考虑的论据并不新鲜，那你为什么要关注它？如果你真的好奇，你会看这里吗？你是不是在下意识地批判自己信念的强点，而不是弱点？你是不是只是在复述证据？

如果你能做到不去重复那些已知的支持理由，并且能让新证据每次都让你的信念下降一点点，你甚至可能最终完全放弃这个信念——意识到证据之风正从哪个方向吹来。

另一种恢复好奇心的方法，是我称之为“塔尔斯基祷文”的东西，其实是一种元祷文，每次都要针对具体情况定制（这正合适）。比如，如果我紧张地想知道一个上锁的盒子里是否有钻石，与其去想盒子里有钻石会带来多美好的后果，不如默念塔尔斯基祷文：

> 如果盒子里有钻石，  
> 我希望自己相信盒子里有钻石；  
> 如果盒子里没有钻石，  
> 我希望自己相信盒子里没有钻石；  
> 不要让我执着于我可能并不想要的信念。

然后你应该冥想“盒子里没有钻石”的可能性，以及如果你相信没有钻石会带来的好处，相信有钻石会带来的坏处。也可以参考根德林祷文。

如果你能在内心找到哪怕一丝真正的不确定，就像护林人守护篝火一样守护它。如果你能让它燃烧成好奇心的火焰，它会让你变得轻盈和热切，为你的提问赋予意义，为你的技能指明方向。

## The Meditation on Curiosity

The first virtue is curiosity.  
—“The Twelve Virtues of Rationality”

As rationalists, we are obligated to criticize ourselves and question our beliefs . . . are we not?

Consider what happens to you, on a psychological level, if you begin by saying: “It is my duty to criticize my own beliefs.” Roger Zelazny once distinguished between “wanting to be an author” versus “wanting to write.” Mark Twain said: “A classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read.” Criticizing yourself from a sense of duty leaves you wanting to have investigated, so that you’ll be able to say afterward that your faith is not blind. This is not the same as wanting to investigate.

This can lead to motivated stopping of your investigation. You consider an objection, then a counterargument to that objection, then you stop there. You repeat this with several objections, until you feel that you have done your duty to investigate, and then you stop there. You have achieved your underlying psychological objective: to get rid of the cognitive dissonance that would result from thinking of yourself as a rationalist and yet knowing that you had not tried to criticize your belief. You might call it purchase of rationalist satisfaction—trying to create a “warm glow” of discharged duty. 

Afterward, your stated probability level will be high enough to justify your keeping the plans and beliefs you started with, but not so high as to evoke incredulity from yourself or other rationalists.

When you’re really curious, you’ll gravitate to inquiries that seem most promising of producing shifts in belief, or inquiries that are least like the ones you’ve tried before. Afterward, your probability distribution likely should not look like it did when you started out—shifts should have occurred, whether up or down; and either direction is equally fine to you, if you’re genuinely curious.

Contrast this to the subconscious motive of keeping your inquiry on familiar ground, so that you can get your investigation over with quickly, so that you can have investigated, and restore the familiar balance on which your familiar old plans and beliefs are based.

As for what I think true curiosity should look like, and the power that it holds, I refer you to “A Fable of Science and Politics” in the first book of this series, Map and Territory. The fable showcases the reactions of different characters to an astonishing discovery, with each character’s response intended to illustrate different lessons. Ferris, the last character, embodies the power of innocent curiosity: which is lightness, and an eager reaching forth for evidence.

Ursula K. LeGuin wrote: “In innocence there is no strength against evil. But there is strength in it for good.”<sup>1</sup> Innocent curiosity may turn innocently awry; and so the training of a rationalist, and its accompanying sophistication, must be dared as a danger if we want to become stronger. Nonetheless we can try to keep the lightness and the eager reaching of innocence.

As it is written in “The Twelve Virtues of Rationality”:

> If in your heart you believe you already know, or if in your heart you do not wish to know, then your questioning will be purposeless and your skills without direction. Curiosity seeks to annihilate itself; there is no curiosity that does not want an answer.

There just isn’t any good substitute for genuine curiosity. A burning itch to know is higher than a solemn vow to pursue truth. But you can’t produce curiosity just by willing it, any more than you can will your foot to feel warm when it feels cold. Sometimes, all we have is our mere solemn vows.

So what can you do with duty? For a start, we can try to take an interest in our dutiful investigations—keep a close eye out for sparks of genuine intrigue, or even genuine ignorance and a desire to resolve it. This goes right along with keeping a special eye out for possibilities that are painful, that you are flinching away from—it’s not all negative thinking.

It should also help to meditate on “Conservation of Expected Evidence.” For every new point of inquiry, for every piece of unseen evidence that you suddenly look at, the expected posterior probability should equal your prior probability. In the microprocess of inquiry, your belief should always be evenly poised to shift in either direction. Not every point may suffice to blow the issue wide open—to shift belief from 70% to 30% probability—but if your current belief is 70%, you should be as ready to drop it to 69% as raise it to 71%. You should not think that you know which direction it will go in (on average), because by the laws of probability theory, if you know your destination, you are already there. If you can investigate honestly, so that each new point really does have equal potential to shift belief upward or downward, this may help to keep you interested or even curious about the microprocess of inquiry.

If the argument you are considering is not new, then why is your attention going here? Is this where you would look if you were genuinely curious? Are you subconsciously criticizing your belief at its strong points, rather than its weak points? Are you rehearsing the evidence?

If you can manage not to rehearse already known support, and you can manage to drop down your belief by one tiny bite at a time from the new evidence, you may even be able to relinquish the belief entirely—to realize from which quarter the winds of evidence are blowing against you.

Another restorative for curiosity is what I have taken to calling the Litany of Tarski, which is really a meta-litany that specializes for each instance (this is only appropriate). For example, if I am tensely wondering whether a locked box contains a diamond, then rather than thinking about all the wonderful consequences if the box does contain a diamond, I can repeat the Litany of Tarski:

> If the box contains a diamond,  
> I desire to believe that the box contains a diamond;  
> If the box does not contain a diamond,  
> I desire to believe that the box does not contain a diamond;  
> Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.

Then you should meditate upon the possibility that there is no diamond, and the subsequent advantage that will come to you if you believe there is no diamond, and the subsequent disadvantage if you believe there is a diamond. See also the Litany of Gendlin.

If you can find within yourself the slightest shred of true uncertainty, then guard it like a forester nursing a campfire. If you can make it blaze up into a flame of curiosity, it will make you light and eager, and give purpose to your questioning and direction to your skills.
