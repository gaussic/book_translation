## 说“哎呀”有多重要

我刚刚读完一本关于安然公司垮台的历史——《房间里最聪明的人们》，我觉得这是“最不合适书名奖”的得主。

安然公司慢性腐烂和突然崩溃的一个并不意外的特征，就是高管们从未承认自己犯过大错。当灾难#247严重到必须真正改变政策时，他们会说：“真遗憾，这事没成——本来是个好主意——我们该怎么把这个问题藏到资产负债表里？”而不是说：“现在回头看，这从一开始就是个错误。”更不是说：“我真是太蠢了。”他们从来没有经历过一个分水岭时刻，没有那种谦卑的顿悟，没有承认根本性问题的时刻。破产后，安然前首席运营官、短暂担任过CEO的杰夫·斯基林，甚至拒绝了自己律师建议他援引第五修正案的建议，在国会作证时还说安然曾是一家伟大的公司。

不是每一次改变都是进步，但每一次进步必然意味着改变。如果我们只承认小的、局部的错误，我们就只会做出小的、局部的改变。承认大错，才会有动力做出重大改变。

我小时候是在科学和科幻小说的熏陶下长大的，从海因莱因到费曼，我学到的都是传统理性的套路：理论必须大胆，要能被证伪；要有勇气在面对相反证据时放弃自己的想法；辩论时要有风度；尽量不要自欺欺人；还有其他一些模糊的口号。

传统理性的培养目标，是让争论者最终会屈服于相反的证据——总得有一座足够高的证据大山能让你改变立场。这并不简单，这也是科学和宗教的分界线。但传统理性并不太强调速度，不强调尽快放弃抵抗，也不强调高效整合证据，让你只需最少的反面证据就能推翻自己珍视的信念。

我是在传统理性主义的氛围中长大的，自认为是个理性主义者。后来我转向了贝叶斯技艺（拉普拉斯/杰恩斯/特沃斯基/卡尼曼），原因嘛……说来话长。大致上，是因为我意识到，传统理性的那些模糊口号并不足以阻止我犯下大错。

当我终于彻底承认自己的错误后，我回顾了导致我可怕顿悟的那条路。我发现，自己其实是一连串小让步、最小让步，一点点地勉强退让，每次都尽量少承认一点错误，每次失败都只承认一点点、能忍受的小损失。如果我当时能直接大喊一声“哎呀！”，我本可以走得快得多。

那时我就想：我得提升自己的水平。

承认自己犯了大错有巨大的好处。虽然很痛苦，但也可能改变你的一生。

拥有那个分水岭时刻、那个谦卑的顿悟时刻非常重要。要承认根本性的问题，而不是把它分割成一口一口能咽下的小错误。

不要沉溺于戏剧化，也不要为承认错误而自豪。第一次就做对当然更好。但如果你真的犯了错，最好一次性全部看清。哪怕从享乐主义角度看，一次性吞下一个大苦药丸，也比分成许多小口慢慢吃要好。否则，你就会和自己拉锯多年。否则，你就会变成安然。

从那以后，我看到别人也在不断做着一连串最小让步，每次都勉强退让一点点；只要能用局部错误糊弄过去，绝不承认全局错误；每次错误都只学到最少的东西。他们本可以一次性自愿解决的问题，却变成了必须被人劝说才会修补的小补丁。没人会在承认一个错误后说“我真是个傻瓜”。他们总是尽量用“原则上我是对的”或者“本来是有可能成功的”，或者“我还是想坚持我所执着的那个真正精髓”来减轻自己的尴尬。为了维护当下的自尊，他们确保自己还会再犯同样的错误，还会再一次为自尊而辩护。

还不如一次性把整个苦药丸吞下去。

## The Importance of Saying “Oops”

I just finished reading a history of Enron’s downfall, The Smartest Guys in the Room, which hereby wins my award for “Least Appropriate Book Title.” 

An unsurprising feature of Enron’s slow rot and abrupt collapse was that the executive players never admitted to having made a large mistake. When catastrophe #247 grew to such an extent that it required an actual policy change, they would say, “Too bad that didn’t work out—it was such a good idea—how are we going to hide the problem on our balance sheet?” As opposed to, “It now seems obvious in retrospect that it was a mistake from the beginning.” As opposed to, “I’ve been stupid.” There was never a watershed moment, a moment of humbling realization, of acknowledging a fundamental problem. After the bankruptcy, Jeff Skilling, the former COO and brief CEO of Enron, declined his own lawyers’ advice to take the Fifth Amendment; he testified before Congress that Enron had been a great company.

Not every change is an improvement, but every improvement is necessarily a change. If we only admit small local errors, we will only make small local changes. The motivation for a big change comes from acknowledging a big mistake.

As a child I was raised on equal parts science and science fiction, and from Heinlein to Feynman I learned the tropes of Traditional Rationality: theories must be bold and expose themselves to falsification; be willing to commit the heroic sacrifice of giving up your own ideas when confronted with contrary evidence; play nice in your arguments; try not to deceive yourself; and other fuzzy verbalisms.

A traditional rationalist upbringing tries to produce arguers who will concede to contrary evidence eventually—there should be some mountain of evidence sufficient to move you. This is not trivial; it distinguishes science from religion. But there is less focus on speed, on giving up the fight as quickly as possible, integrating evidence efficiently so that it only takes a minimum of contrary evidence to destroy your cherished belief.

I was raised in Traditional Rationality, and thought myself quite the rationalist. I switched to Bayescraft (Laplace / Jaynes / Tversky / Kahneman) in the aftermath of . . . well, it’s a long story. Roughly, I switched because I realized that Traditional Rationality’s fuzzy verbal tropes had been insufficient to prevent me from making a large mistake.

After I had finally and fully admitted my mistake, I looked back upon the path that had led me to my Awful Realization. And I saw that I had made a series of small concessions, minimal concessions, grudgingly conceding each millimeter of ground, realizing as little as possible of my mistake on each occasion, admitting failure only in small tolerable nibbles. I could have moved so much faster, I realized, if I had simply screamed “OOPS!” 

And I thought: I must raise the level of my game.

There is a powerful advantage to admitting you have made a large mistake. It’s painful. It can also change your whole life.

It is important to have the watershed moment, the moment of humbling realization. To acknowledge a fundamental problem, not divide it into palatable bite-size mistakes.

Do not indulge in drama and become proud of admitting errors. It is surely superior to get it right the first time. But if you do make an error, better by far to see it all at once. Even hedonically, it is better to take one large loss than many small ones. The alternative is stretching out the battle with yourself over years. The alternative is Enron.

Since then I have watched others making their own series of minimal concessions, grudgingly conceding each millimeter of ground; never confessing a global mistake where a local one will do; always learning as little as possible from each error. What they could fix in one fell swoop voluntarily, they transform into tiny local patches they must be argued into. Never do they say, after confessing one mistake, I’ve been a fool. They do their best to minimize their embarrassment by saying I was right in principle, or It could have worked, or I still want to embrace the true essence of whatever-I’m-attached-to. Defending their pride in this passing moment, they ensure they will again make the same mistake, and again need to defend their pride.

Better to swallow the entire bitter pill in one terrible gulp.
