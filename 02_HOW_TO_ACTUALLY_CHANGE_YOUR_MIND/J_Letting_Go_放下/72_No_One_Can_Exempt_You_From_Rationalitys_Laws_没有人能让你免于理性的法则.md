## 没有人能让你免于理性的法则

传统理性主义用社会规则来表述，违反这些规则就等同于作弊——等同于背离合作规范。如果你想让我接受你的某个信念，你就有义务为我提供一定量的证据。如果你试图逃避，我们都知道你是在逃避自己的责任。一个理论有义务为自己做出大胆的预测，而不是只偷用其他理论辛苦得出的预测。一个理论有义务让自己可以被证伪——如果它试图逃避，就像试图逃避可怕的入会仪式一样；你必须付出应有的代价。

传统理性主义的表述方式类似于人类社会的习俗，这让它很容易通过口口相传传播。人类在识别社会作弊方面，比识别抽象逻辑规则的同构违规要可靠得多。<sup>1</sup> 但把理性视为一种社会义务，会引发一些奇怪的想法。

比如，有些宗教人士会这样为自己的信仰辩护：“你也无法为你对科学的信仰提供正当理由！”换句话说，“你怎么敢批评我信仰没有证据，你这个伪君子！你自己也一样！”

对贝叶斯主义者来说，大脑是一个追求准确的引擎：它处理并整合纠缠的证据，形成反映现实的地图。理性的原则和热力学第二定律一样，是一种规律：获得可靠信念需要一定量的纠缠证据，就像让冰箱可靠制冷需要一定量的自由能一样。

原则上，物理定律是时间可逆的，所以冰箱自发制冷并发电的概率极其微小——除了数学家之外，其他人几乎无法区分它和零。你坐在家里拉上窗帘、断网，却能准确画出纽约的详细街道地图，这种概率也只比前者大一点点。但我劝你别抱太大希望。

在你尝试绘制未知领域的地图之前，先往杯子里倒点常温的水，看看它会不会自己结冰再说。这样你就能确定“忽略极其微小的成功概率”这个通用法则确实有效。你可能不会直接意识到自己的地图错了，尤其是你从未去过纽约；但你能看到水不会自己结冰。

如果理性的规则只是社会习俗，那么当你指出别人也在做同样的事时，似乎就可以为自己的行为X开脱。如果我们自己都无法提供证据，那要求你提供证据也不公平。我们会意识到大家都半斤八两，于是就会心软，仁慈地免除你提供信仰证据的社会义务。然后我们就能在自由、平等、博爱的幸福生活中安然无恙。

但如果理性的规则是数学定律，那么试图通过“别人也没证据”来为自己无证据的信念辩护，就和列出三十条你不该从悬崖上掉下去的理由一样无效。即使我们都投票说冰箱不该需要电，它还是不会运行（概率约等于1）。即使我们都投票说你不必去纽约，地图还是会错。大自然女士对这种恳求一向无动于衷，数学女士也是如此。

所以——回到传统理性的社会语言——别以为你可以用“别人也有随意的信念”来为自己随意相信XYZ开脱。如果合同双方都表现得一样糟糕，法官可能决定都不处罚。但如果两个工程师都把发动机设计得一样糟糕，那两个发动机都不会工作。一个设计错误不能为另一个错误开脱。即使我在XYZ上做错了，这对你没有任何帮助，也不能让你免于规则；这只意味着我们俩都完蛋了。

在人类法律（自由民主国家）中，每个人都有权拥有自己的信念。而在自然法则面前，你没有权利获得准确。我们不会因为别人信怪东西就抓他们，至少在更明智的国家不会。但没有人能废除“你需要证据才能获得准确信念”这条法则。哪怕全人类投票，也无法在自然法庭上获得宽恕。

物理学家并不决定物理定律，他们只是猜测定律是什么。理性主义者也不决定理性的法则，我们只是猜测它们是什么。你无法“合理化”本身就不合理的东西。如果你极具说服力，让全世界的物理学家都相信你可以免于重力定律，然后你从悬崖上跳下去，你还是会摔下去。甚至“我们不决定”这句话都太拟人化了。没有更高的权威能让你免除这些法则。只有因果律而已。

当你请求“这一次就放过我吧”时，请记住这一点。我们无法原谅你。这不取决于我们。

## No One Can Exempt You From Rationality’s Laws

Traditional Rationality is phrased in terms of social rules, with violations interpretable as cheating—as defections from cooperative norms. If you want me to accept a belief from you, you are obligated to provide me with a certain amount of evidence. If you try to get out of it, we all know you’re cheating on your obligation. A theory is obligated to make bold predictions for itself, not just steal predictions that other theories have labored to make. A theory is obligated to expose itself to falsification—if it tries to duck out, that’s like trying to duck out of a fearsome initiation ritual; you must pay your dues.

Traditional Rationality is phrased similarly to the customs that govern human societies, which makes it easy to pass on by word of mouth. Humans detect social cheating with much greater reliability than isomorphic violations of abstract logical rules.<sup>1</sup> But viewing rationality as a social obligation gives rise to some strange ideas.

For example, one finds religious people defending their beliefs by saying, “Well, you can’t justify your belief in science!” In other words, “How dare you criticize me for having unjustified beliefs, you hypocrite! You’re doing it too!”

To Bayesians, the brain is an engine of accuracy: it processes and concentrates entangled evidence into a map that reflects the territory. The principles of rationality are laws in the same sense as the Second Law of Thermodynamics: obtaining a reliable belief requires a calculable amount of entangled evidence, just as reliably cooling the contents of a refrigerator requires a calculable minimum of free energy.

In principle, the laws of physics are time-reversible, so there’s an infinitesimally tiny probability—indistinguishable from zero to all but mathematicians—that a refrigerator will spontaneously cool itself down while generating electricity. There’s a slightly larger infinitesimal chance that you could accurately draw a detailed street map of New York without ever visiting, sitting in your living room with your blinds closed and no Internet connection. But I wouldn’t hold your breath.

Before you try mapping an unseen territory, pour some water into a cup at room temperature and wait until it spontaneously freezes before proceeding. That way you can be sure the general trick—ignoring infinitesimally tiny probabilities of success—is working properly. You might not realize directly that your map is wrong, especially if you never visit New York; but you can see that water doesn’t freeze itself.

If the rules of rationality are social customs, then it may seem to excuse behavior X if you point out that others are doing the same thing. It wouldn’t be fair to demand evidence from you, if we can’t provide it ourselves. We will realize that none of us are better than the rest, and we will relent and mercifully excuse you from your social obligation to provide evidence for your belief. And we’ll all live happily ever afterward in liberty, fraternity, and equality.

If the rules of rationality are mathematical laws, then trying to justify evidence-free belief by pointing to someone else doing the same thing will be around as effective as listing thirty reasons why you shouldn’t fall off a cliff. Even if we all vote that it’s unfair for your refrigerator to need electricity, it still won’t run (with probability ∼1). Even if we all vote that you shouldn’t have to visit New York, the map will still be wrong. Lady Nature is famously indifferent to such pleading, and so is Lady Math.

So—to shift back to the social language of Traditional Rationality—don’t think you can get away with claiming that it’s okay to have arbitrary beliefs about XYZ, because other people have arbitrary beliefs too. If two parties to a contract both behave equally poorly, a human judge may decide to impose penalties on neither. But if two engineers design their engines equally poorly, neither engine will work. One design error cannot excuse another. Even if I’m doing XYZ wrong, it doesn’t help you, or exempt you from the rules; it just means we’re both screwed.

As a matter of human law in liberal democracies, everyone is entitled to their own beliefs. As a matter of Nature’s law, you are not entitled to accuracy. We don’t arrest people for believing weird things, at least not in the wiser countries. But no one can revoke the law that you need evidence to generate accurate beliefs. Not even a vote of the whole human species can obtain mercy in the court of Nature.

Physicists don’t decide the laws of physics, they just guess what they are. Rationalists don’t decide the laws of rationality, we just guess what they are. You cannot “rationalize” anything that is not rational to begin with. If by dint of extraordinary persuasiveness you convince all the physicists in the world that you are exempt from the law of gravity, and you walk off a cliff, you’ll fall. Even saying “We don’t decide” is too anthropomorphic. There is no higher authority that could exempt you. There is only cause and effect.

Remember this, when you plead to be excused just this once. We can’t excuse you. It isn’t up to us.
