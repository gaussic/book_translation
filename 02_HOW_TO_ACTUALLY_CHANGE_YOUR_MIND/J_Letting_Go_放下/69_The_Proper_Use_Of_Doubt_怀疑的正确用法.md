## 怀疑的正确用法

有一次，我在讲述“道”的时候，提到大多数有组织的信仰体系其实都是在逃避怀疑。听众中有人反驳说，耶稣会士（Jesuits）应该不受这个批评，因为他们实行有组织的怀疑：他说，耶稣会士的初学者会被要求怀疑基督教、怀疑上帝的存在、怀疑自己的使命是否真实、怀疑自己是否适合终身守贞和贫穷的誓言。我问：“但他们最终不是应该克服这些怀疑吗？”他说：“不是，他们还要怀疑自己的怀疑会不会变得更强烈。”

我在网上查证，既没有证实也没有否定这种说法。但无论这是否真实地描述了耶稣会士，我都觉得这个情景很有意思，值得讨论。如果耶稣会士真的像上面描述的那样刻意练习怀疑，那么他们作为理性主义者是否就算美德高尚呢？

我认为，即使在上述（可能是假设的）情景下，耶稣会士也不能被称为“逃避怀疑”。但这种（可能是假设的）做法依然让我觉得很可疑。对于真正美德高尚的理性主义者来说，怀疑本不该是可怕的。上述做法听起来更像是对某种极度恐惧的事物进行脱敏训练，就像让恐蛛症患者在严格控制下接触蜘蛛一样。

但即便如此，他们确实是在鼓励初学者怀疑——对吧？他们的理由是否有缺陷重要吗？这难道不是理性主义者应当称道的行为吗？

所有的好奇心都渴望自我消灭；没有哪种好奇心不想得到答案。但一旦你得到了答案、满足了好奇心，原本神秘的美好也就不再神秘了。

同样，每一个怀疑都存在于消灭某个特定信念的目的之中。如果怀疑没能摧毁目标信念，这个怀疑就算是未竟其功地“死去”了——但这依然是一种结局，只是更令人遗憾而已。一个既没有自我消解、也没有消解目标的怀疑，倒不如从未存在过。推动理性进步的，是怀疑的解决，而不仅仅是怀疑本身。

每一次进步都是一种改变，但不是每一次改变都是进步。每个理性主义者都会怀疑，但不是所有怀疑都是理性的。戴着怀疑的外衣并不能让你成为理性主义者，就像穿上白大褂也不能让你成为医生一样。

理性的怀疑总是出于某个具体原因——你有某种具体的理由怀疑某个信念是错的。这个理由反过来又意味着你可以通过某种调查来验证，要么推翻目标信念，要么消除怀疑。即使是非常抽象的怀疑，比如“我想知道是否有更简单的假说也能解释这些数据”，你也可以通过尝试构思更简单的假说来调查。随着这种探索越来越久没有结果，你会越来越觉得下一个尝试成功的概率很低。最终，继续探索的成本会超过预期收益，你就会停止搜索。此时你就不能再说自己是在有意义地怀疑了。没有被调查的怀疑，等同于不存在。每一个怀疑都注定要以某种方式自我消解。未被解决的怀疑是无效操作；它既不会推动进步，也不会让你倒退。

如果你真的相信某种宗教（而不是仅仅“信仰”它），那你为什么要让初学者去思考那些注定不会有结果的怀疑？这就像让物理学生纠结于20世纪的物理革命是不是个错误，牛顿力学其实一直才是对的。如果你并不真的怀疑某事，为什么要假装自己在怀疑？

因为我们都希望被视为理性——而怀疑被广泛认为是理性主义者的美德。但很少有人明白，怀疑需要具体理由，或者说未被解决的怀疑其实是无效操作。人们往往以为怀疑只是谦逊、低调、维护部落地位等级——这和我以前写过的“谦逊”问题几乎一模一样。为了让自己相信自己是理性主义者而大张旗鼓地展示怀疑，其实和穿白大褂没什么两样。

为了避免只是“宣称怀疑”，请记住：<sup>1</sup>

- 理性的怀疑是为了摧毁目标信念，如果没能摧毁目标信念，它就会未竟其功地消亡。
- 理性的怀疑总是源于某个具体的理由，怀疑这个信念可能是错的。
- 未被解决的怀疑是无效操作。
- 没有被调查的怀疑等同于不存在。
- 你不应该为单纯的怀疑而自豪，但当你刚刚彻底推翻了自己珍视的信念时，你完全可以为此感到自豪。
- 也许直面怀疑需要勇气，但别忘了，对理想的头脑来说，怀疑本来就不该是可怕的。

## The Proper Use of Doubt

Once, when I was holding forth upon the Way, I remarked upon how most organized belief systems exist to flee from doubt. A listener replied to me that the Jesuits must be immune from this criticism, because they practice organized doubt: their novices, he said, are told to doubt Christianity; doubt the existence of God; doubt if their calling is real; doubt that they are suitable for perpetual vows of chastity and poverty. And I said: Ah, but they’re supposed to overcome these doubts, right? He said: No, they are to doubt that perhaps their doubts may grow and become stronger.

Googling failed to confirm or refute these allegations. But I find this scenario fascinating, worthy of discussion, regardless of whether it is true or false of Jesuits. If the Jesuits practiced deliberate doubt, as described above, would they therefore be virtuous as rationalists?

I think I have to concede that the Jesuits, in the (possibly hypothetical) scenario above, would not properly be described as “fleeing from doubt.” But the (possibly hypothetical) conduct still strikes me as highly suspicious. To a truly virtuous rationalist, doubt should not be scary. The conduct described above sounds to me like a program of desensitization for something very scary, like exposing an arachnophobe to spiders under carefully controlled conditions.

But even so, they are encouraging their novices to doubt—right? Does it matter if their reasons are flawed? Is this not still a worthy deed unto a rationalist?

All curiosity seeks to annihilate itself; there is no curiosity that does not want an answer. But if you obtain an answer, if you satisfy your curiosity, then the glorious mystery will no longer be mysterious.

In the same way, every doubt exists in order to annihilate some particular belief. If a doubt fails to destroy its target, the doubt has died unfulfilled—but that is still a resolution, an ending, albeit a sadder one. A doubt that neither destroys itself nor destroys its target might as well have never existed at all. It is the resolution of doubts, not the mere act of doubting, which drives the ratchet of rationality forward.

Every improvement is a change, but not every change is an improvement. Every rationalist doubts, but not all doubts are rational. Wearing doubts doesn’t make you a rationalist any more than wearing a white medical lab coat makes you a doctor.

A rational doubt comes into existence for a specific reason—you have some specific justification to suspect the belief is wrong. This reason, in turn, implies an avenue of investigation which will either destroy the targeted belief or destroy the doubt. This holds even for highly abstract doubts, like: “I wonder if there might be a simpler hypothesis which also explains this data.” In this case you investigate by trying to think of simpler hypotheses. As this search continues longer and longer without fruit, you will think it less and less likely that the next increment of computation will be the one to succeed. Eventually the cost of searching will exceed the expected benefit, and you’ll stop searching. At which point you can no longer claim to be usefully doubting. A doubt that is not investigated might as well not exist. Every doubt exists to destroy itself, one way or the other. An unresolved doubt is a null-op; it does not turn the wheel, neither forward nor back.

If you really believe a religion (and don’t just believe in it), then why would you tell your novices to consider doubts that must die unfulfilled? It would be like telling physics students to agonize over whether the twentieth-century revolution might have been a mistake, and that Newtonian mechanics was correct all along. If you don’t really doubt something, why would you pretend that you do?

Because we all want to be seen as rational—and doubting is widely believed to be a virtue of a rationalist. But it is not widely understood that you need a particular reason to doubt, or that an unresolved doubt is a null-op. Instead people think it’s about modesty, a submissive demeanor, maintaining the tribal status hierarchy—almost exactly the same problem as with humility, on which I have previously written. Making a great public display of doubt to convince yourself that you are a rationalist will do around as much good as wearing a lab coat.

To avoid merely professing doubts,<sup>1</sup>remember:

- A rational doubt exists to destroy its target belief, and if it does not destroy its target it dies unfulfilled.
- A rational doubt arises from some specific reason the belief might be wrong.
- An unresolved doubt is a null-op.
- An uninvestigated doubt might as well not exist.
- You should not be proud of mere doubting, although you can justly be proud when you have just finished tearing a cherished belief to shreds.
- Though it may take courage to face your doubts, never forget that to an ideal mind doubt would not be scary in the first place.
