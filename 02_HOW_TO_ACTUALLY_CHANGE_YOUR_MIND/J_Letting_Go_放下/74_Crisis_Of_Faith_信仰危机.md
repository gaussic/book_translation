## 信仰危机

除非结果真的有可能朝任何一个方向发展，否则这不算真正的信仰危机。  
——托尔·申克尔

这个世界上有很多人坚持着一些连十岁小孩都能一眼看穿其漏洞的信念，只要这个十岁小孩是第一次听到这些信念。我们说的并不是那些微妙的错误。如果能像十岁小孩那样毫无包袱地怀疑，这些信念对于一个不执着的人来说，放弃起来简直易如反掌。正如 Premise Checker 所说：“如果‘上帝’这个概念直到科学时代才出现，只有极其古怪的人才会发明出这样的想法，并假装它能解释什么。”<sup>1</sup>

然而，即使是技艺高超的科学专家，甚至是某个领域的主要创新者，即使在当今时代，也未必能真正做到这种怀疑。诺贝尔奖得主、奥曼一致性定理的提出者罗伯特·奥曼，就是一位正统犹太教徒：我可以相当有把握地说，奥曼肯定在某个时刻质疑过自己的信仰。但他并没有成功地怀疑。我们改变想法的频率远没有自己以为的那么高。

这应该让你从骨子里感到害怕。这意味着，即使你是世界级的科学家，精通贝叶斯数学，也可能无法放弃一个连十岁小孩都能看出荒谬的信念。这说明，如果一个信念在你心中盘踞已久，它可以为自己筑起坚不可摧的防御堡垒。

要打败一个已经筑起堡垒的错误，需要什么？

但等你意识到它是错误时，它其实已经被打败了。真正的难题不是“我该如何放弃长期持有的错误信念X？”，而是“我怎么知道长期持有的信念X是错的？”当我们不确定哪条路才是正道时，自我诚实最为脆弱。所以问题变成了：

    我们如何在内心制造出一种真正的信仰危机，让结果真的有可能朝任何一个方向发展？

宗教是我们都能想象的试验场。<sup>2</sup> 但如果你已经完全失去同理心，把有神论者当成邪恶的异类，那你就无法想象他们内心真正的挣扎。你也无法提出这样的问题：

    一个宗教信徒要采取什么通用策略，才能逃离自己的宗教？

我敢肯定，有些人在看到这个挑战时，已经开始复述一堆标准的无神论论点——“他们必须承认没有任何贝叶斯证据支持上帝存在”，“他们必须看到自己在为圣经中上帝的行为找借口时的道德回避”，“他们需要学会使用奥卡姆剃刀——”

错！错错错！这种复述你早就想过的观点的做法，正是让人困在原有宗教中的思维方式。如果你总是依赖脑海中缓存的想法，如果你的大脑太快给出显而易见的答案，以至于你无法真正“原初地”思考，你就绝不可能经历真正的信仰危机。

也许只是因为太多人小时候没读过《哥德尔、艾舍尔、巴赫》，但我发现很大一部分人——即便是技术圈的人——都很难跟上这种“元层级”的推理。<sup>3</sup> 有时候我悲观地想，也许人类真的分两种。

即使你明确指出，有些人似乎也无法从对象层面的“用奥卡姆剃刀！你得明白你的上帝是个多余的假设！”跳到元层面的“试着让你的大脑不要用惯常的方式自动补全这个模式！”因为，就像你所有理性主义朋友都把奥卡姆剃刀当成好东西一样，奥卡姆剃刀也会立刻跳进你的脑海；同样，宗教圈里公认的标准回应是“上帝的道路是神秘的，妄自以为我们能理解祂是傲慢的”。所以，如果你认为“用奥卡姆剃刀”就是通用策略，就像有神论者认为“信仰”是通用策略一样。

“但是——但是奥卡姆剃刀确实比信仰好！这可不是喜欢不同口味冰淇淋那么简单！任何人看看历史都能发现，奥卡姆式推理比信仰有用多了——”

这些都没错。但这不是重点。重点是，你说这些时，其实只是在复述脑海中早已存在的标准理由。信仰危机的挑战在于，要能应对“也许我们的标准结论是错的，我们的标准理由也是错的”这种情况。

所以，如果X的标准理由是“奥卡姆剃刀！”，而你想围绕X发起一场信仰危机，你就应该质疑奥卡姆剃刀是否真的支持X，你对奥卡姆剃刀的理解是否正确，以及——如果你想怀疑得足够深——简洁性这种标准在历史上在这个问题上是否真的有效，或者是否有理由期待它有效，等等。如果你会建议宗教信徒质疑“信仰”是否是X的好理由，那么你也应该同样努力地质疑“奥卡姆剃刀”是否是X的好理由。<sup>4</sup>

如果“奥卡姆剃刀！”是你和你朋友们的标准回答——那么如果你真的想发起一场信仰危机，你最好让自己的大脑不要立刻自动补全这个模式。

更好的做法是这样想：“想象一个怀疑论者会怎么说——再想象他们会怎么反驳你的回应——再想象他们还能说出什么更难回答的话。”

或者，“试着去想那个最让你痛苦的念头。”

最重要的规则是：

    付出和有神论者放弃宗教一样拼命的努力。

因为如果你没有那么努力，那么——你头脑里可能塞满了和宗教一样糟糕的胡言乱语。

如果没有那种剧烈、痛苦的理性努力——就像挣脱宗教枷锁那样的努力——那么当罗伯特·奥曼都相信上帝时，你又凭什么相信任何东西？

有人（我忘了是谁）曾说，人只有在某个年龄之前才有可能放弃自己的宗教信仰。之后他们会对所有反对意见都有现成的答案，那时就太晚了。你必须超越那样的状态。这是对你作为理性主义者的考验，非常严峻；如果你过不了，你甚至不如一个十岁小孩。

但再说一次，等你知道某个信念是错的，它其实已经被打败了。所以我们说的不是在你已经认定宗教是错之后，拼命挣脱宗教影响的那种努力。我们说的是拼命努力去弄清楚你到底该不该挣脱枷锁。自我诚实最脆弱的时候，就是我们不知道该走哪条路的时候——那时各种自我辩解还不那么明显是“罪”。

并不是每一个怀疑都需要发起一场彻底的信仰危机。但你应该在以下情况下考虑这么做：

- 某个信念在你心中存在已久；
- 它被一大堆已知的论据和反驳包围着；
- 你在这个信念上有沉没成本（时间、金钱、公开表态）；
- 这个信念有情感影响（注意，这并不意味着它就是错的）；
- 它已经和你的个性混在一起。

这些警示信号都不是直接的反证。这些特征让一个信念面临各种风险，也让它在错误时很难被放弃。而且这些特征不仅适用于教皇的天主教信仰，也适用于道金斯对进化生物学的信念。

这也不意味着我们只是在讨论不同口味的冰淇淋。两种信念可以带来同样深刻的情感依恋，但它们获得的证据支持却完全不同。关键不是要让信念变得浅薄，而是要让你的地图真实反映现实。

我之所以强调这些，是为了让你可以对自己承认“我的信念有这些警示信号”，而不用对自己说“我的信念是错的”。

但这些警示信号真正标志的是：这样的信念需要超出常规的努力才能有效怀疑。你需要比平常更多的努力，才能以一种如果信念真的错了你就真的会放弃它的方式去怀疑。如果你做不到这一点，你就是盲目的，因为你的大脑会无条件地坚持这个信念。就像视网膜无论进来多少光子都发出同样信号，我们称那只眼睛为“盲”。

什么时候该发起信仰危机？

还是想想你会给有神论者什么建议：如果你发现自己内心有点不稳，却在努力为信念找理由证明它依然牢固，那你大概就该发起一场信仰危机了。如果这个信念像重力一样坚不可摧，那你就不用担心——但想想那些拼命想证明“上帝和重力一样坚固”的有神论者吧。所以试着想象外面的怀疑论者会怎么反驳你“像重力一样坚固”的论点。当然，你可能无法发起信仰危机的一个原因，就是你从未真正静下心来质疑过——你从未对自己说：“这是我需要认真努力怀疑的东西。”

如果你的思路变得这么复杂，那就去发起一场信仰危机吧。不要随便应付；不要在零碎的空闲时间里草草了事。不要急着赶快做完，好让自己说“我已经怀疑过了，尽了义务”。这种做法对有神论者没用，对你也没用。前一天好好休息，保持良好的精神状态。安排几个不被打扰的小时，找个安静的地方坐下。把所有标准论据都清空，试着从头看起。拼尽全力，努力提出真正的怀疑，去摧毁一个虚假的——而且仅仅是虚假的——根深蒂固的信念。

信仰危机的技巧其实分散在很多文章里：

- 避开信念真正的弱点——信仰危机时最常见的诱惑之一，就是去怀疑信念最强的部分，这样你就能反复演练自己的好答案。你需要主动寻找最痛苦的地方，而不是那些让你觉得安心的论点。
- 好奇心的冥想——Roger Zelazny 曾区分过“想成为作家”和“想写作”，同样也有“想调查过”和“想去调查”的区别。光说“批判自己是我的责任”还不够；你必须真的好奇，只有不确定性才能激发好奇心。记住“期望证据守恒”有助于你逐步修正自己：每当你考虑一个新点、每当有新论据和新证据时，你都不应该预期信念会（平均）朝某个方向偏移更多。这样你每次都能真正好奇结果会怎样。
- 原初观察——防止标准的缓存想法冲进来、自动补全模式。
- 根德林祷文和塔尔斯基祷文——人们能够承受真实，因为他们早已在承受它。如果一个信念是真的，你相信它会更好；如果是假的，你放弃它会更好。你会建议宗教信徒努力充分、深入地设想没有上帝的世界，并且毫无借口地彻底理解：如果没有上帝，那么相信没有上帝会让自己更好。如果一个人无法在情感层面接受这一点，他就无法经历信仰危机。所以你也应该真诚努力，像最优秀的怀疑论者希望你那样，去设想你的信念的另一种可能。想想一个宗教信徒要付出多大努力，才能不为自我安慰而扭曲地想象无神论者的宇宙观。
- Tsuyoku Naritai!——变得更强的渴望。
- 遗传启发式——如果你有很多想法都来自一个你现在知道不可信的来源，但这些想法似乎全都对，你就要极度警惕。
- 说“哎呀”的重要性——一次性吞下整个苦药丸其实没那么痛苦。
- 单一思维——双重思想的反面。注意那些你本能回避、只在脑海角落一闪而过的念头。如果你能意识到自己没在想什么，你就能去想它。
- 情感死亡螺旋与抵抗幸福死亡螺旋——情感死亡螺旋是制造虚假信念的主要根源，需要信仰危机才能摆脱。但情感死亡螺旋也可能围绕真实且美好的事物展开，所以你不必承认自己的信念是谎言，也要在每个环节抵抗光环效应——即使是真正美好的事物，也要拒绝虚假的赞美。政策争论不应只有一边倒的声音。
- 暂缓提出解决方案——在问题被充分讨论之前，不要提出任何解决方案。让你的大脑暂时不要知道答案是什么；在放弃之前至少努力五分钟——无论一般情况下还是在尝试“魔鬼视角”时尤其如此。

还有一些在《如何真正改变你的想法》和《地图与领地》中讨论过的标准技巧也特别相关：

- 关于“底线”和“合理化”的系列，解释了为什么只为辩论的一方辩护总是错的。
- 积极偏见、动机性怀疑和动机性停止，防止你只选择性地寻找支持、只选择性地寻找反反驳、只选择性地在争论变危险前就停下来。遗漏的备选方案是动机性停止的一种特殊情况。动机性怀疑的一个特例是假谦逊，就是你羞涩地承认没人能知道你其实不想知道的东西。不要对反方论据选择性地要求过高权威。
- 警惕语义终止符、掌声灯，以及“解释、崇拜、忽略”三选一的陷阱。
- 感受繁琐细节的重量——每一个细节都是一个独立的负担，一个危机点。

其实，这里和 Overcoming Bias 上还有很多相关内容。有些概念我还没来得及正式介绍。比如“一生悬命”——那种拼尽全力、极度剧烈的理性努力。那是你要超越罗伯特·奥曼和历史上所有未能挣脱信仰的伟大科学家的努力。

信仰危机只是更长久的“一生悬命”中的关键点和突发冲突——那是一种终身不妥协的努力，要理性到足以超越愚蠢错误的层次。那是你终于有机会把长期练习的技能全力用在自己身上的时刻。

祝你在与自己的对手较量时好运。祝你有一场精彩的信仰危机！

## Crisis of Faith

It ain’t a true crisis of faith unless things could just as easily go either way.  
—Thor Shenkel

Many in this world retain beliefs whose flaws a ten-year-old could point out, if that ten-year-old were hearing the beliefs for the first time. These are not subtle errors we’re talking about. They would be child’s play for an unattached mind to relinquish, if the skepticism of a ten-year-old were applied without evasion. As Premise Checker put it, “Had the idea of god not come along until the scientific age, only an exceptionally weird person would invent such an idea and pretend that it explained anything.”<sup>1</sup>

And yet skillful scientific specialists, even the major innovators of a field, even in this very day and age, do not apply that skepticism successfully. Nobel laureate Robert Aumann, of Aumann’s Agreement Theorem, is an Orthodox Jew: I feel reasonably confident in venturing that Aumann must, at one point or another, have questioned his faith. And yet he did not doubt successfully. We change our minds less often than we think.

This should scare you down to the marrow of your bones. It means you can be a world-class scientist and conversant with Bayesian mathematics and still fail to reject a belief whose absurdity a fresh-eyed ten-year-old could see. It shows the invincible defensive position which a belief can create for itself, if it has long festered in your mind.

What does it take to defeat an error that has built itself a fortress?

But by the time you know it is an error, it is already defeated. The dilemma is not “How can I reject long-held false belief X?” but “How do I know if long-held belief X is false?” Self-honesty is at its most fragile when we’re not sure which path is the righteous one. And so the question becomes:  

    How can we create in ourselves a true crisis of faith, that could just as easily go either way?

Religion is the trial case we can all imagine.<sup>2</sup> But if you have cut off all sympathy and now think of theists as evil mutants, then you won’t be able to imagine the real internal trials they face. You won’t be able to ask the question:  

    What general strategy would a religious person have to follow in order to escape their religion?

I’m sure that some, looking at this challenge, are already rattling off a list of standard atheist talking points—“They would have to admit that there wasn’t any Bayesian evidence for God’s existence,” “They would have to see the moral evasions they were carrying out to excuse God’s behavior in the Bible,” “They need to learn how to use Occam’s Razor—”

WRONG! WRONG WRONG WRONG! This kind of rehearsal, where you just cough up points you already thought of long before, is exactly the style of thinking that keeps people within their current religions. If you stay with your cached thoughts, if your brain fills in the obvious answer so fast that you can’t see originally, you surely will not be able to conduct a crisis of faith.

Maybe it’s just a question of not enough people reading Gödel, Escher, Bach at a sufficiently young age, but I’ve noticed that a large fraction of the population—even technical folk—have trouble following arguments that go this meta.<sup>3</sup> On my more pessimistic days I wonder if the camel has two humps.

Even when it’s explicitly pointed out, some people seemingly cannot follow the leap from the object-level “Use Occam’s Razor! You have to see that your God is an unnecessary belief!” to the meta-level “Try to stop your mind from completing the pattern the usual way!” Because in the same way that all your rationalist friends talk about Occam’s Razor like it’s a good thing, and in the same way that Occam’s Razor leaps right up into your mind, so too, the obvious friend-approved religious response is “God’s ways are mysterious and it is presumptuous to suppose that we can understand them.” So for you to think that the general strategy to follow is “Use Occam’s Razor,” would be like a theist saying that the general strategy is to have faith.

“But—but Occam’s Razor really is better than faith! That’s not like preferring a different flavor of ice cream! Anyone can see, looking at history, that Occamian reasoning has been far more productive than faith—”

Which is all true. But beside the point. The point is that you, saying this, are rattling off a standard justification that’s already in your mind. The challenge of a crisis of faith is to handle the case where, possibly, our standard conclusions are wrong and our standard justifications are wrong.

So if the standard justification for X is “Occam’s Razor!” and you want to hold a crisis of faith around X, you should be questioning if Occam’s Razor really endorses X, if your understanding of Occam’s Razor is correct, and—if you want to have sufficiently deep doubts—whether simplicity is the sort of criterion that has worked well historically in this case, or could reasonably be expected to work, et cetera. If you would advise a religionist to question their belief that “faith” is a good justification for X, then you should advise yourself to put forth an equally strong effort to question your belief that “Occam’s Razor” is a good justification for X.<sup>4</sup>

If “Occam’s Razor!” is your usual reply, your standard reply, the reply that all your friends give—then you’d better block your brain from instantly completing that pattern, if you’re trying to instigate a true crisis of faith. 

Better to think of such rules as, “Imagine what a skeptic would say—and then imagine what they would say to your response—and then imagine what else they might say, that would be harder to answer.”

Or, “Try to think the thought that hurts the most.”

And above all, the rule:  

    Put forth the same level of desperate effort that it would take for a theist to reject their religion.

Because if you aren’t trying that hard, then—for all you know—your head could be stuffed full of nonsense as bad as religion.

Without a convulsive, wrenching effort to be rational, the kind of effort it would take to throw off a religion—then how dare you believe anything, when Robert Aumann believes in God?

Someone (I forget who) once observed that people had only until a certain age to reject their religious faith. Afterward they would have answers to all the objections, and it would be too late. That is the kind of existence you must surpass. This is a test of your strength as a rationalist, and it is very severe; but if you cannot pass it, you will be weaker than a ten-year-old.

But again, by the time you know a belief is an error, it is already defeated. So we’re not talking about a desperate, convulsive effort to undo the effects of a religious upbringing, after you’ve come to the conclusion that your religion is wrong. We’re talking about a desperate effort to figure out if you should be throwing off the chains, or keeping them. Self-honesty is at its most fragile when we don’t know which path we’re supposed to take—that’s when rationalizations are not obviously sins.

Not every doubt calls for staging an all-out Crisis of Faith. But you should consider it when:

- A belief has long remained in your mind;
- It is surrounded by a cloud of known arguments and refutations;
- You have sunk costs in it (time, money, public declarations);
- The belief has emotional consequences (remember that this does not make it wrong);
- It has gotten mixed up in your personality generally.

None of these warning signs are immediate disproofs. These attributes place a belief at risk for all sorts of dangers, and make it very hard to reject when it is wrong. And they hold for Richard Dawkins’s belief in evolutionary biology, not just the Pope’s Catholicism.

Nor does this mean that we’re only talking about different flavors of ice cream. Two beliefs can inspire equally deep emotional attachments without having equal evidential support. The point is not to have shallow beliefs, but to have a map that reflects the territory.

I emphasize this, of course, so that you can admit to yourself, “My belief has these warning signs,” without having to say to yourself, “My belief is false.”

But what these warning signs do mark is a belief that will take more than an ordinary effort to doubt effectively. It will take more than an ordinary effort to doubt in such a way that if the belief is in fact false, you will in fact reject it. And where you cannot doubt in this way, you are blind, because your brain will hold the belief unconditionally. When a retina sends the same signal regardless of the photons entering it, we call that eye blind.<sup>5</sup>

When should you stage a Crisis of Faith?  

Again, think of the advice you would give to a theist: If you find yourself feeling a little unstable inwardly, but trying to rationalize reasons the belief is still solid, then you should probably stage a Crisis of Faith. If the belief is as solidly supported as gravity, you needn’t bother—but think of all the theists who would desperately want to conclude that God is as solid as gravity. So try to imagine what the skeptics out there would say to your “solid as gravity” argument. Certainly, one reason you might fail at a crisis of faith is that you never really sit down and question in the first place—that you never say, “Here is something I need to put effort into doubting properly.”

If your thoughts get that complicated, you should go ahead and stage a Crisis of Faith. Don’t try to do it haphazardly; don’t try it in an ad-hoc spare moment. Don’t rush to get it done with quickly, so that you can say, “I have doubted, as I was obliged to do.” That wouldn’t work for a theist, and it won’t work for you either. Rest up the previous day, so you’re in good mental condition. Allocate some uninterrupted hours. Find somewhere quiet to sit down. Clear your mind of all standard arguments; try to see from scratch. And make a desperate effort to put forth a true doubt that would destroy a false—and only a false—deeply held belief.

Elements of the Crisis of Faith technique have been scattered over many essays:

- Avoiding Your Belief’s Real Weak Points—One of the first temptations in a crisis of faith is to doubt the strongest points of your belief, so that you can rehearse your good answers. You need to seek out the most painful spots, not the arguments that are most reassuring to consider.
- The Meditation on Curiosity—Roger Zelazny once distinguished between “wanting to be an author” versus “wanting to write,” and there is likewise a distinction between wanting to have investigated and wanting to investigate. It is not enough to say, “It is my duty to criticize my own beliefs”; you must be curious, and only uncertainty can create curiosity. Keeping in mind conservation of expected evidence may help you update yourself incrementally: for every single point that you consider, and each element of new argument and new evidence, you should not expect your beliefs to shift more (on average) in one direction than another. Thus you can be truly curious each time about how it will go.
- Original Seeing—To prevent standard cached thoughts from rushing in and completing the pattern.
- The Litany of Gendlin and the Litany of Tarski—People can stand what is true, for they are already enduring it. If a belief is true, you will be better off believing it, and if it is false, you will be better off rejecting it. You would advise a religious person to try to visualize fully and deeply the world in which there is no God, and to, without excuses, come to the full understanding that if there is no God then they will be better off believing there is no God. If one cannot come to accept this on a deep emotional level, one will not be able to have a crisis of faith. So you should put in a sincere effort to visualize the alternative to your belief, the way that the best and highest skeptic would want you to visualize it. Think of the effort a religionist would have to put forth to imagine, without corrupting it for their own comfort, an atheist’s view of the universe.
- Tsuyoku Naritai!—The drive to become stronger.
- The Genetic Heuristic—You should be extremely suspicious if you have many ideas suggested by a source that you now know to be untrustworthy, but by golly, it seems that all the ideas still ended up being right.
- The Importance of Saying “Oops”—It really is less painful to swallow the entire bitter pill in one terrible gulp.
- Singlethink—The opposite of doublethink. See the thoughts you flinch away from, that appear in the corner of your mind for just a moment before you refuse to think them. If you become aware of what you are not thinking, you can think it.
- Affective Death Spirals and Resist the Happy Death Spiral—Affective death spirals are prime generators of false beliefs that it will take a Crisis of Faith to shake loose. But since affective death spirals can also get started around real things that are genuinely nice, you don’t have to admit that your belief is a lie, to try and resist the halo effect at every point—refuse false praise even of genuinely nice things. Policy debates should not appear one-sided.
- Hold Off On Proposing Solutions—Don’t propose any solutions until the problem has been discussed as thoroughly as possible. Make your mind hold off on knowing what its answer will be; and try for five minutes before giving up—both generally, and especially when pursuing the devil’s point of view.

And these standard techniques, discussed in How to Actually Change Your Mind and Map and Territory, are particularly relevant:

- The sequence on the bottom line and rationalization, which explains why it is always wrong to selectively argue one side of a debate.
- Positive bias, motivated skepticism, and motivated stopping, lest you selectively look for support, selectively look for counter-counterarguments, and selectively stop the argument before it gets dangerous. Missing alternatives are a special case of stopping. A special case of motivated skepticism is fake humility, where you bashfully confess that no one can know something you would rather not know. Don’t selectively demand too much authority of counterarguments.
- Beware of semantic stopsigns, applause lights, and the choice between explaining, worshiping, and ignoring something.
- Feel the weight of burdensome details—each detail a separate burden, a point of crisis.

But really, there’s rather a lot of relevant material, here and on Overcoming Bias. There are ideas I have yet to properly introduce. There is the concept of isshokenmei—the desperate, extraordinary, convulsive effort to be rational. The effort that it would take to surpass the level of Robert Aumann and all the great scientists throughout history who never broke free of their faiths.

The Crisis of Faith is only the critical point and sudden clash of the longer isshoukenmei—the lifelong uncompromising effort to be so incredibly rational that you rise above the level of stupid damn mistakes. It’s when you get a chance to use the skills that you’ve been practicing for so long, all-out against yourself.

I wish you the best of luck against your opponent. Have a wonderful crisis!
