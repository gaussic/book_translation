**老练者（The Sophisticate）**：“世界不是非黑即白。没有人是纯粹的好人或坏人，一切都是灰色的。因此，没有人比别人更好。”

**怀疑者（The Zetet）**：“你只看到灰色，就得出所有灰色都是同一个色调的结论。你嘲笑黑白分明的简单世界观，却用单一颜色的世界观取而代之……”

——马克·斯蒂格勒，《大卫之弓》（*David’s Sling*）

我不知道老练者的错误是否有一个正式的名字，但我称之为**灰色谬误**（Fallacy of Gray）。我们在上一篇文章中已经见识过这种谬误——那个人相信七亿五千万分之一的概率仍然意味着“还有机会”。对他而言，所有概率只是“有不确定性”，这就赋予了他随意忽略它们的权利。

“月亮是绿奶酪做的” 和 “太阳主要由氢和氦组成” 都是不确定命题，但它们不是同一种不确定性。

确实，一切都是灰色调的，但有些灰接近白色，有些灰接近黑色。即便不是黑白分明，我们仍然可以比较色调，说“这个更暗”、“那个更亮”。

多年前，我作为一个理性主义者成长过程中，有个奇怪而关键的时刻，就是读到伊恩·M·班克斯的小说《游戏者》（*Player of Games*）中的这一段，尤其是**加粗的那一句话**：

> “一个有罪的体制无法容忍无辜者。就像所有非此即彼的权力结构一样，我们站在其对立面。如果你思考一下，也会和我们一样。你思考的方式本身就将你归入了敌对阵营。这或许不是你的错，因为\*\*每个社会都会把它的一些价值观强加于其所养育的人，但关键在于，有些社会力图最大化这种影响，而有些则力图最小化它。\*\*你来自后者之一，而现在你被要求向前者之一解释自己。搪塞推诿比你想象的要难；中立几乎是不可能的。你无法选择没有你的政治立场；那不是某种与你的本体可以分离的东西；那是你存在的一部分。我知道这一点，他们也知道；你最好接受它。”

现在，请不要愤怒地评论说，如果一个社会减少对人价值观的灌输，那么每一代人都得从头开始。那不是我从这段话里读到的内容。

我从这段话里得到的，是一件回头看似乎显而易见的事——我本可能从一百个地方得到这个认知，但就是这一段让我彻底“开窍”。

这段话让我意识到：**“量化思维方式”（Quantitative Way）可以应用于生活中的道德判断和自我改善的问题。即使你不能将某事彻底从“开”变为“关”，你仍可以尝试增加或减少它。**

这听起来是否过于显而易见，不值得一提？我认为不然。许多博主在评论 *Overcoming Bias*（克服偏见）时说：“这是不可能的，没人能完全消除偏见。”哪怕说这话的人是专业经济学家，也显然还没有理解“量化思维”在日常生活和自我成长中的意义。**那些我无法完全消除的东西，依然值得被尽可能减少。**

再来看 Robin Hanson 和 Tyler Cowen 的一次对话<sup>1</sup>。Hanson 说他在经济决策中倾向于将至少 75% 的权重放在经济理论上，而非直觉：“我尽量直接应用经济理论，尽量少加入个人或文化判断。” Cowen 回应道：

> “在我看来，根本不存在‘直接应用经济理论’这种事……所有理论的应用都不可避免地要通过我们个人和文化的滤镜，没有其他可能的方式。”

是的，但你可以**努力减少**这种影响，或者**做一些只会加重这种影响的事**。如果你努力减少它，那在很多情况下，把你的输出称为“直接应用”并不算不合理——即便在经济学中也是如此。

“每个人都有缺点。”莫罕达斯·甘地有缺点，约瑟夫·斯大林也有缺点，但他们的缺点程度显然不同。“每个人都有缺点”就是典型的用单色视角取代双色视角的例子。如果你说：“没有人是完美的，但有些人比其他人更接近完美。”你也许不会赢得掌声，但**对那些努力变得更好的人而言，你提供了希望**。毕竟，没有人是“完美地不完美”。

（每当有人对我说：“完美主义对你不好。”我总会回答：“我觉得不必完美，但最好不要差到让人看出来。”）

同样，那些说“每一个科学范式都带有某种先验假设影响它解释实验的方式”的人，也常会陷入另一种谬误，仿佛这就能把科学和巫术放在同一水平线上。**每一种世界观都对观察施加一定的结构性影响，但关键是，有的世界观努力**减少**这种影响，有的世界观则对此**引以为傲\*\*。没有绝对的白色，但确实存在比其他更亮的灰色，而把它们都视为一样，则是一种愚蠢。

如果月亮在过去几十亿年中一直绕地球运行，如果你在过去的岁月中一直看到它高挂夜空，并预期明天也能在预定位置与相位见到它——这不是“绝对确定”。而如果你相信一个隐形的龙能治愈你女儿的癌症，这同样也不是“确定”的。但这两种“不确定性”的程度有着天壤之别：**一种是你可用 12 位小数精度预测的规律重复现象，另一种则是对违反既有规律的期望**。把它们都称作“信仰”，未免太宽泛了。

这种心理机制颇为奇特——“科学也是基于信仰的！”通常这句话出自那些自己主张“信仰是好东西”的人。那么，\*\*你为何以愤怒+胜利的语气说出“科学也是信仰！”而不是当作一种夸奖？\*\*从他们的立场看，这其实是个危险的夸奖。如果科学是种宗教，那它就是那种能治病、能揭示宇宙奥秘的宗教。那你可以说：“科学的祭司们能够堂而皇之地登陆月球作为信仰奇迹，而你们的祭司做不到。”你确定你想这么说吗，亲爱的信仰主义者？也许你应该考虑收回“科学也是一种宗教”这整套说法。

这里还有一种奇怪的动态：你努力让你的灰色更纯净，直到它相当接近白色，然后就有人站起来用深受冒犯的语气说：“但它不是白色！它是灰色！”如果有人指出：“这还没你想象的那么亮，原因是 X、Y、Z。”那倒还好。但如果有人只是愤怒地说“它不是白，是灰！”却不给出任何具体的问题点，那就是另一回事了。

在这种情况下，我往往会怀疑其心理机制比普通情况更加扭曲——**他们可能已经与自己的错误做了某种魔鬼交易，于是拒绝听到任何有关改进的可能性**。当有人找到了不再努力变好的借口时，他们往往也拒绝承认别人可以努力变好，从此将一切进步的方式视作敌人，所有关于前进的主张都成了对他们的冒犯。于是，他们一边骄傲地说：“我乐于为灰色代言。”一边愤怒地说：“你也是灰的！”

即使没有黑与白，也仍然存在更亮与更暗，而**不是所有灰色都一样**。

评论者 G2 提醒我们阿西莫夫的《错误的相对性》（*The Relativity of Wrong*）中的一句话：

> 当人们认为地球是平的时，他们错了。
> 当人们认为地球是个完美的球体时，他们也错了。
> 但如果你认为这两种错误是一样的错误，那么你的错误比它们两个加起来还严重。

## The Fallacy of Gray

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

The Sophisticate: “The world isn’t black and white. No one does pure good or pure bad. It’s all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else.”

The Zetet: “Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color view . . .”

-—Marc Stiegler, David’s Sling

I don’t know if the Sophisticate’s mistake has an official name, but I call it the Fallacy of Gray. We saw it manifested in the previous essay—the one who believed that odds of two to the power of seven hundred and fifty millon to one, against, meant “there was still a chance.” All probabilities, to him, were simply “uncertain” and that meant he was licensed to ignore them if he pleased.

“The Moon is made of green cheese” and “the Sun is made of mostly hydrogen and helium” are both uncertainties, but they are not the same uncertainty.

Everything is shades of gray, but there are shades of gray so light as to be very nearly white, and shades of gray so dark as to be very nearly black. Or even if not, we can still compare shades, and say “it is darker” or “it is lighter.”

Years ago, one of the strange little formative moments in my career as a rationalist was reading this paragraph from Player of Games by Iain M. Banks, especially the sentence in bold:

A guilty system recognizes no innocents. As with any power apparatus which thinks everybody’s either for it or against it, we’re against it. You would be too, if you thought about it. The very way you think places you amongst its enemies. This might not be your fault, because **every society imposes some of its values on those raised within it, but the point is that some societies try to maximize that effect, and some try to minimize it.** You come from one of the latter and you’re being asked to explain yourself to one of the former. Prevarication will be more difficult than you might imagine; neutrality is probably impossible. You cannot choose not to have the politics you do; they are not some separate set of entities somehow detachable from the rest of your being; they are a function of your existence. I know that and they know that; you had better accept it.

Now, don’t write angry comments saying that, if societies impose fewer of their values, then each succeeding generation has more work to start over from scratch. That’s not what I got out of the paragraph.

What I got out of the paragraph was something which seems so obvious in retrospect that I could have conceivably picked it up in a hundred places; but something about that one paragraph made it click for me.

It was the whole notion of the Quantitative Way applied to life-problems like moral judgments and the quest for personal self-improvement. That, even if you couldn’t switch something from on to off, you could still tend to increase it or decrease it.

Is this too obvious to be worth mentioning? I say it is not too obvious, for many bloggers have said of Overcoming Bias: “It is impossible, no one can completely eliminate bias.” I don’t care if the one is a professional economist, it is clear that they have not yet grokked the Quantitative Way as it applies to everyday life and matters like personal self-improvement. That which I cannot eliminate may be well worth reducing.

Or consider an exchange between Robin Hanson and Tyler Cowen.<sup>1</sup> Robin Hanson said that he preferred to put at least 75% weight on the prescriptions of economic theory versus his intuitions: “I try to mostly just straightforwardly apply economic theory, adding little personal or cultural judgment.” Tyler Cowen replied:

In my view there is no such thing as “straightforwardly applying economic theory” . . . theories are always applied through our personal and cultural filters and there is no other way it can be.

Yes, but you can try to minimize that effect, or you can do things that are bound to increase it. And if you try to minimize it, then in many cases I don’t think it’s unreasonable to call the output “straightforward”—even in economics.

“Everyone is imperfect.” Mohandas Gandhi was imperfect and Joseph Stalin was imperfect, but they were not the same shade of imperfection. “Everyone is imperfect” is an excellent example of replacing a two-color view with a one-color view. If you say, “No one is perfect, but some people are less imperfect than others,” you may not gain applause; but for those who strive to do better, you have held out hope. No one is perfectly imperfect, after all.

(Whenever someone says to me, “Perfectionism is bad for you,” I reply: “I think it’s okay to be imperfect, but not so imperfect that other people notice.”)

Likewise the folly of those who say, “Every scientific paradigm imposes some of its assumptions on how it interprets experiments,” and then act like they’d proven science to occupy the same level with witchdoctoring. Every worldview imposes some of its structure on its observations, but the point is that there are worldviews which try to minimize that imposition, and worldviews which glory in it. There is no white, but there are shades of gray that are far lighter than others, and it is folly to treat them as if they were all on the same level.

If the Moon has orbited the Earth these past few billion years, if you have seen it in the sky these last years, and you expect to see it in its appointed place and phase tomorrow, then that is not a certainty. And if you expect an invisible dragon to heal your daughter of cancer, that too is not a certainty. But they are rather different degrees of uncertainty—this business of expecting things to happen yet again in the same way you have previously predicted to twelve decimal places, versus expecting something to happen that violates the order previously observed. Calling them both “faith” seems a little too un-narrow.

It’s a most peculiar psychology—this business of “Science is based on faith too, so there!” Typically this is said by people who claim that faith is a good thing. Then why do they say “Science is based on faith too!” in that angry-triumphal tone, rather than as a compliment? And a rather dangerous compliment to give, one would think, from their perspective. If science is based on “faith,” then science is of the same kind as religion—directly comparable. If science is a religion, it is the religion that heals the sick and reveals the secrets of the stars. It would make sense to say, “The priests of science can blatantly, publicly, verifiably walk on the Moon as a faith-based miracle, and your priests’ faith can’t do the same.” Are you sure you wish to go there, oh faithist? Perhaps, on further reflection, you would prefer to retract this whole business of “Science is a religion too!”

There’s a strange dynamic here: You try to purify your shade of gray, and you get it to a point where it’s pretty light-toned, and someone stands up and says in a deeply offended tone, “But it’s not white! It’s gray!” It’s one thing when someone says, “This isn’t as light as you think, because of specific problems X, Y , and Z.” It’s a different matter when someone says angrily “It’s not white! It’s gray!” without pointing out any specific dark spots.

In this case, I begin to suspect psychology that is more imperfect than usual—that someone may have made a devil’s bargain with their own mistakes, and now refuses to hear of any possibility of improvement. When someone finds an excuse not to try to do better, they often refuse to concede that anyone else can try to do better, and every mode of improvement is thereafter their enemy, and every claim that it is possible to move forward is an offense against them. And so they say in one breath proudly, “I’m glad to be gray,” and in the next breath angrily, “And you’re gray too!”

If there is no black and white, there is yet lighter and darker, and not all grays are the same.

The commenter G2 points us to Asimov’s “The Relativity of Wrong”:

When people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.
