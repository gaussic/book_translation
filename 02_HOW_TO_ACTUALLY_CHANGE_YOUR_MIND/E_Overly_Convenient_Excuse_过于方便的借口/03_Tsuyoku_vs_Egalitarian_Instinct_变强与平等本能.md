## Tsuyoku 与平等本能

狩猎采集部落通常高度平等（至少对男性而言）——全权部落酋长主要出现在农业社会，在祖先环境中很少见。在大多数狩猎采集部落中，猎人如果猎获了惊人的猎物，也会小心翼翼地淡化自己的成就，以避免引起嫉妒。

也许，如果你一开始低于平均水平，你可以在不敢超越群体的情况下提升自己。但迟早，如果你想做到最好，你就会把目标定在平均线之上。

如果你无法承认自己做得比别人好——或者你为想要做得比别人更好而感到羞愧——那么中位数就会永远成为你的高墙，成为你停止前进的地方。那么那些低于平均水平的人呢？你敢说你打算做得比他们更好吗？你也太傲慢了吧！

也许，以自己比别人做得更好为傲并不健康。就我个人而言，尽管我的原则并不鼓励，但我发现这是一种有用的动力，我会接受一切能激励自己的方式。也许这种竞争本质上是零和游戏，但围棋也是如此；如果人们觉得有趣、能带来收获，我们也没必要废除这种人类活动。

但无论如何，羞于做得更好肯定不是健康的心态。

而且，人生并不是按曲线打分的。超越的意志没有终点，也不会变成“想做得更差”的意志；没有终点线的赛跑，也没有金牌或银牌。只要尽你所能地奔跑，不必担心会不会超过其他跑者。（但要注意：如果你真的不去担心，总有一天你可能真的会超越别人。如果你无视后果，后果也许就会降临。）

迟早，如果你走在正确的道路上，你会着手改正大多数人还未改正的缺陷。迟早，如果你的努力结出果实，你会发现自己需要忏悔的罪行变少了。

也许你会发现，哪怕成功了，低调一点才是明智之举。人们也许会原谅你达阵，但不会原谅你在达阵区跳舞。你肯定会发现，公开否认自己的价值、假装自己和大家一样有缺陷，会更快、更容易、更方便——只要大家都心知肚明这不是真的就行。只要大家都知道你有多少值得谦虚的资本，炫耀自己的谦逊也会变得有趣。

但不要让这成为你旅程的终点。即使只是对自己低语，也要低语：Tsuyoku, tsuyoku！更强，更强！

然后再为自己设定一个更高的目标。这才是你意识到自己依然有缺陷（虽然少了一点）的真正意义。它意味着永远向更高处攀登，无需羞愧。

Tsuyoku naritai！我会一直拼尽全力奔跑，即使超越了别人也不停下，总有一天会有人超过我；但即使我落后了，我也会一直拼尽全力奔跑。

## Tsuyoku vs. the Egalitarian Instinct

Hunter-gatherer tribes are usually highly egalitarian (at least if you’re male)—the all-powerful tribal chieftain is found mostly in agricultural societies, rarely in the ancestral environment. Among most hunter-gatherer tribes, a hunter who brings in a spectacular kill will carefully downplay the accomplishment to avoid envy.

Maybe, if you start out below average, you can improve yourself without daring to pull ahead of the crowd. But sooner or later, if you aim to do the best you can, you will set your aim above the average.

If you can’t admit to yourself that you’ve done better than others—or if you’re ashamed of wanting to do better than others—then the median will forever be your concrete wall, the place where you stop moving forward. And what about people who are below average? Do you dare say you intend to do better than them? How prideful of you!

Maybe it’s not healthy to pride yourself on doing better than someone else. Personally I’ve found it to be a useful motivator, despite my principles, and I’ll take all the useful motivation I can get. Maybe that kind of competition is a zero-sum game, but then so is Go; it doesn’t mean we should abolish that human activity, if people find it fun and it leads somewhere interesting.

But in any case, surely it isn’t healthy to be ashamed of doing better.

And besides, life is not graded on a curve. The will to transcendence has no point beyond which it ceases and becomes the will to do worse; and the race that has no finish line also has no gold or silver medals. Just run as fast as you can, without worrying that you might pull ahead of other runners. (But be warned: If you refuse to worry about that possibility, someday you may pull ahead. If you ignore the consequences, they may happen to you.)

Sooner or later, if your path leads true, you will set out to mitigate a flaw that most people have not mitigated. Sooner or later, if your efforts bring forth any fruit, you will find yourself with fewer sins to confess.

Perhaps you will find it the course of wisdom to downplay the accomplishment, even if you succeed. People may forgive a touchdown, but not dancing in the end zone. You will certainly find it quicker, easier, more convenient to publicly disclaim your worthiness, to pretend that you are just as much a sinner as everyone else. Just so long, of course, as everyone knows it isn’t true. It can be fun to proudly display your modesty, so long as everyone knows how very much you have to be modest about.

But do not let that be the endpoint of your journeys. Even if you only whisper it to yourself, whisper it still: Tsuyoku, tsuyoku! Stronger, stronger!

And then set yourself a higher target. That’s the true meaning of the realization that you are still flawed (though a little less so). It means always reaching higher, without shame.

Tsuyoku naritai! I’ll always run as fast as I can, even if I pull ahead, I’ll keep on running; and someone, someday, will surpass me; but even though I fall behind, I’ll always run as fast as I can.
