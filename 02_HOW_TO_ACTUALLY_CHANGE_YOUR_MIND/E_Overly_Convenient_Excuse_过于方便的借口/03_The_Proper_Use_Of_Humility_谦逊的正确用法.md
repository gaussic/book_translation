## 谦逊的正确使用

作者：埃利泽·尤德科夫斯基

人们普遍认为，好的科学需要某种形式的谦逊。但究竟是哪种谦逊，却是一个有争议的话题。

想象一位创造论者说：“但谁能真正知道进化论是否正确呢？它只是一个理论。你应该更谦逊一点，更开放一些。” 这是谦逊吗？创造论者表现出一种非常挑剔的缺乏自信，拒绝整合大量支持某个结论的证据，因为这个结论让他们感到不舒服。我会说，无论你是否称之为“谦逊”，这都是舞蹈中的错误步骤。

再看一位工程师，他谦逊地在机械中设计了备用安全机制，尽管他非常确定机械不会发生故障。这似乎是一种好的谦逊。历史上，并不罕见工程师坚信新机器不会故障，但机器最终还是出现了故障。

再看一位学生，他谦逊地重新检查数学考试的答案。我仍然认为这是一种好的谦逊。重新检查答案的学生希望变得更强大；他们通过修复可能存在的内在缺陷来应对这种可能性。

那位学生说：“无论我检查多少次，我永远不能确定我的答案是正确的。”于是他根本没有检查一次。这种选择，即使源于类似于前一位学生的情感，仍然不那么明智。

你建议他更加努力学习，这位学生回应：“不，这对我来说不起作用；我不像你们这些聪明的孩子；不，我这么低微的人，不可能得到更好的命运。”这是社交上的谦虚，而不是科学的谦逊。这与调节部落中的社会地位有关，而非科学过程。如果你要求某人“更加谦逊”，他们通常会将这个词与社交谦虚联系起来——这是一个直觉的、日常的、与祖先相关的概念。科学谦逊则是一个较新的、精细的发明，它并不天生具有社交性质。即使你孤身穿着太空服，远离地球，周围没有人，你仍然会实践科学谦逊。即便你得到一个绝对的保证，告诉你无论你说什么、想什么，没人会再批评你，你仍然会再次检查你的计算，如果你足够明智。

学生说：“但我看到其他学生重新检查他们的答案，结果还是错了。或者根据归纳问题，这次2 + 2 = 5，谁能知道呢？无论我做什么，我都无法确定自己。”这听起来很深刻，也很谦虚。但学生想要迅速交卷，回家玩游戏，这并非巧合。

物理学一个时代的结束并不总是伴随着雷鸣和号角；更多的是从看似微不足道的小缺陷开始……但因为物理学家们常常抱有这种傲慢的想法：他们的模型应该始终有效，而不仅仅是大部分时间有效，他们会对小缺陷进行跟进。通常，经过仔细检查，小缺陷会消失。但有时，缺陷会扩大，直到它摧毁整个理论。因此有句话说：“如果你不追求完美，你就会在迈出第一步之前停下。”

但是，想想看，总是试图一直是对的，难道不具备社交的大胆吗！我怀疑，如果科学宣称进化论大部分时间是正确的，但并非每时每刻都是正确的，或者如果科学承认某些日子地球是平的，但谁能知道——那么科学家的社会声誉可能会更好。科学会被视为不那么对立，因为我们不再需要与声称地球是平的人争论——会有更多的妥协空间。当你争论太多时，人们会看你是对立的。如果你反复拒绝妥协，情况会更糟。把它当作部落地位的问题来考虑：科学家无疑通过诸如医学和手机等社会有用的工具，赢得了一些额外的地位。但这个社会地位并不为他们坚持只有进化论的科学思想应该在公立学校教授提供正当理由。毕竟，神职人员也有很高的社会地位。科学家们有些过于自负了——他们赢得了一些地位，现在他们觉得自己是整个部落的首领！他们应该更加谦逊一些，做出一些妥协。

许多人似乎对“理性谦逊”有一种模糊的看法。拥有一个你只模糊理解的规范性原则是危险的；你的心理模型可能有太多自由度，以至于它可以适应任何行为的辩解。人们拥有模糊的心理模型，这些模型可以用来辩论任何事物，他们通常最终会相信他们一开始就想相信的东西。这是如此方便，以至于人们往往不愿意放弃模糊性。但我们的伦理目的是推动我们，而不是被我们所推动。

“谦逊”是一种常常被误解的美德。这并不意味着我们应该丢弃谦逊的概念，但我们在使用它时应小心。我们可以通过观察“谦逊”思维所推荐的行为，来问自己：“这种方式的行为是让你更强大，还是更弱小？”如果你考虑到归纳问题应用于需要保持稳固的桥梁，可能会得出结论：无论采取什么预防措施，都无法确保什么是确定的；但如果你考虑到实际中增加几根额外的钢缆与无所作为的区别，你就会很清楚，什么做法更能让桥梁更坚固。

我见过的大多数“理性谦逊”的呼吁，都是为放弃而找借口。买了彩票的人说：“但你不能知道我会输。”不相信进化论的人说：“但你不能证明它是真的。”不敢面对困难问题的人说：“这问题可能太难解决了。”问题在于动机怀疑主义，也就是不想相信的事情我们会更加严密地审查。<sup>1</sup> 以最常被误解的形式，谦逊就是一种完全通用的借口，不相信任何事；毕竟，你不能确定。要警惕这种完全通用的借口！

另一个问题是，谦逊太容易去宣扬。丹尼特在《打破魔咒：宗教作为一种自然现象》中指出，尽管许多宗教信条很难相信，但人们很容易相信自己应该相信它们。丹尼特把这种现象称为“信仰中的信仰”。如果我们真正假设并真正相信“三等于一”，这意味着什么呢？比起真正相信三等于一，更容易的是相信你应该相信三等于一，并且在教堂的适当时刻作出这样的回应。丹尼特建议，应该把许多“宗教信仰”当作“宗教宣称”来研究——即人们认为自己应该相信的，和他们知道自己应该说的。

面对每一个反驳时，轻而易举的做法就是说：“当然，我可能是错的。”然后，经过对谦虚的正式致敬，完成必要的屈膝动作，你就可以继续按照原计划走自己的路，而不改变任何东西。

诱惑总是想用最少的努力获得最多的分数。诱惑在于仔细整合所有的信息，并以一种让我们尽量不改变信念，尤其是不改变行为的方式来处理。约翰·肯尼斯·加尔布雷思说：“面对改变主意的选择和证明不需要改变主意的选择时，几乎每个人都忙着去证明。”<sup>2</sup> 而改变主意的不便越大，人们会花费更多的精力去证明自己是对的。

但你知道，如果你反正要做同样的事情，那就没有必要做出如此大的努力去为它辩解。很多时候，我看到人们接收了新的信息，显然接受了它，然后仔细解释为什么他们仍然会做与之前计划一样的事情，只不过换了一个理由。思考的意义在于塑造我们的计划；如果你反正会坚持相同的计划，为什么还要费力去为它辩解呢？当你遇到新的信息时，困难的部分是更新和反应，而不是让信息就这样消失在黑洞里。而谦逊，恰好是一种完美的黑洞——你只需要承认自己可能是错的。因此有句话说：“谦逊是采取具体的行动来预见自己的错误。承认自己的错误后却什么也不做，并不是谦逊，而是在炫耀自己的谦虚。”

## The Proper Use of Humility

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

It is widely recognized that good science requires some kind of humility. What sort of humility is more controversial.

Consider the creationist who says: “But who can really know whether evolution is correct? It is just a theory. You should be more humble and open-minded.” Is this humility? The creationist practices a very selective underconfidence, refusing to integrate massive weights of evidence in favor of a conclusion they find uncomfortable. I would say that whether you call this “humility” or not, it is the wrong step in the dance.

What about the engineer who humbly designs fail-safe mechanisms into machinery, even though they’re damn sure the machinery won’t fail? This seems like a good kind of humility to me. Historically, it’s not unheard-of for an engineer to be damn sure a new machine won’t fail, and then it fails anyway.

What about the student who humbly double-checks the answers on their math test? Again I’d categorize that as good humility. The student who double-checks their answers wants to become stronger; they react to a possible inner flaw by doing what they can to repair the flaw.

What about a student who says, “Well, no matter how many times I check, I can’t ever be certain my test answers are correct,” and therefore doesn’t check even once? Even if this choice stems from an emotion similar to the emotion felt by the previous student, it is less wise.

You suggest studying harder, and the student replies: “No, it wouldn’t work for me; I’m not one of the smart kids like you; nay, one so lowly as myself can hope for no better lot.” This is social modesty, not humility. It has to do with regulating status in the tribe, rather than scientific process. If you ask someone to “be more humble,” by default they’ll associate the words to social modesty—which is an intuitive, everyday, ancestrally relevant concept. Scientific humility is a more recent and rarefied invention, and it is not inherently social. Scientific humility is something you would practice even if you were alone in a spacesuit, light years from Earth with no one watching. Or even if you received an absolute guarantee that no one would ever criticize you again, no matter what you said or thought of yourself. You’d still double-check your calculations if you were wise.

The student says: “But I’ve seen other students double-check their answers and then they still turned out to be wrong. Or what if, by the problem of induction, 2 + 2 = 5 this time around? No matter what I do, I won’t be sure of myself.” It sounds very profound, and very modest. But it is not coincidence that the student wants to hand in the test quickly, and go home and play video games.

The end of an era in physics does not always announce itself with thunder and trumpets; more often it begins with what seems like a small, small flaw . . . But because physicists have this arrogant idea that their models should work all the time, not just most of the time, they follow up on small flaws. Usually, the small flaw goes away under closer inspection. Rarely, the flaw widens to the point where it blows up the whole theory. Therefore it is written: “If you do not seek perfection you will halt before taking your first steps.”

But think of the social audacity of trying to be right all the time! I seriously suspect that if Science claimed that evolutionary theory is true most of the time but not all of the time—or if Science conceded that maybe on some days the Earth is flat, but who really knows—then scientists would have better social reputations. Science would be viewed as less confrontational, because we wouldn’t have to argue with people who say the Earth is flat—there would be room for compromise. When you argue a lot, people look upon you as confrontational. If you repeatedly refuse to compromise, it’s even worse. Consider it as a question of tribal status: scientists have certainly earned some extra status in exchange for such socially useful tools as medicine and cellphones. But this social status does not justify their insistence that only scientific ideas on evolution be taught in public schools. Priests also have high social status, after all. Scientists are getting above themselves—they won a little status, and now they think they’re chiefs of the whole tribe! They ought to be more humble, and compromise a little.

Many people seem to possess rather hazy views of “rationalist humility.” It is dangerous to have a prescriptive principle which you only vaguely comprehend; your mental picture may have so many degrees of freedom that it can adapt to justify almost any deed. Where people have vague mental models that can be used to argue anything, they usually end up believing whatever they started out wanting to believe. This is so convenient that people are often reluctant to give up vagueness. But the purpose of our ethics is to move us, not be moved by us.

“Humility” is a virtue that is often misunderstood. This doesn’t mean we should discard the concept of humility, but we should be careful using it. It may help to look at the actions recommended by a “humble” line of thinking, and ask: “Does acting this way make you stronger, or weaker?” If you think about the problem of induction as applied to a bridge that needs to stay up, it may sound reasonable to conclude that nothing is certain no matter what precautions are employed; but if you consider the real-world difference between adding a few extra cables, and shrugging, it seems clear enough what makes the stronger bridge.

The vast majority of appeals that I witness to “rationalist’s humility” are excuses to shrug. The one who buys a lottery ticket, saying, “But you can’t know that I’ll lose.” The one who disbelieves in evolution, saying, “But you can’t prove to me that it’s true.” The one who refuses to confront a difficult-looking problem, saying, “It’s probably too hard to solve.” The problem is motivated skepticism a.k.a. disconfirmation bias—more heavily scrutinizing assertions that we don’t want to believe.<sup>1</sup> Humility, in its most commonly misunderstood form, is a fully general excuse not to believe something; since, after all, you can’t be sure. Beware of fully general excuses!

A further problem is that humility is all too easy to profess. Dennett, in Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon, points out that while many religious assertions are very hard to believe, it is easy for people to believe that they ought to believe them. Dennett terms this “belief in belief.” What would it mean to really assume, to really believe, that three is equal to one? It’s a lot easier to believe that you should, somehow, believe that three equals one, and to make this response at the appropriate points in church. Dennett suggests that much “religious belief” should be studied as “religious profession”—what people think they should believe and what they know they ought to say.

It is all too easy to meet every counterargument by saying, “Well, of course I could be wrong.” Then, having dutifully genuflected in the direction of Modesty, having made the required obeisance, you can go on about your way without changing a thing.

The temptation is always to claim the most points with the least effort. The temptation is to carefully integrate all incoming news in a way that lets us change our beliefs, and above all our actions, as little as possible. John Kenneth Galbraith said: “Faced with the choice of changing one’s mind and proving that there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof.”<sup>2</sup> And the greater the inconvenience of changing one’s mind, the more effort people will expend on the proof.

But y’know, if you’re gonna do the same thing anyway, there’s no point in going to such incredible lengths to rationalize it. Often I have witnessed people encountering new information, apparently accepting it, and then carefully explaining why they are going to do exactly the same thing they planned to do previously, but with a different justification. The point of thinking is to shape our plans; if you’re going to keep the same plans anyway, why bother going to all that work to justify it? When you encounter new information, the hard part is to update, to react, rather than just letting the information disappear down a black hole. And humility, properly misunderstood, makes a wonderful black hole—all you have to do is admit you could be wrong. Therefore it is written: “To be humble is to take specific actions in anticipation of your own errors. To confess your fallibility and then do nothing about it is not humble; it is boasting of your modesty.”
