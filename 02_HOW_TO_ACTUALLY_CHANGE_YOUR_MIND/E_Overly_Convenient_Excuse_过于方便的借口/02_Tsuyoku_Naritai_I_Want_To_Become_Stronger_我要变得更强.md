## Tsuyoku Naritai!（我想变得更强）

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

在正统犹太教中，有一句话：“上一代人对下一代就如同天使对人类；下一代人对上一代人就如同驴子对人类。”这源自正统犹太教的信仰，即所有犹太法律都是上帝在西奈山赐给摩西的。毕竟，不是你可以通过实验获得新的哈拉卡（犹太教法）的知识；你唯一知道的方式是通过别人告诉你（他们从别人那里听到的，而那个人从上帝那里听到的）。既然没有新的信息来源，那就只能通过世代相传而逐渐退化。

因此，现代的拉比不能推翻古代的拉比。爬行的生物通常是不可食用的，但如果苹果里有一只虫子，是可以吃的——古代的拉比认为虫子是自发生成在苹果里的，因此它是苹果的一部分。一个现代拉比不能说：“嗯，古代的拉比对生物学一无所知。推翻！”一个现代拉比不可能知道古代拉比不知道的哈拉卡原则，因为古代的拉比如何能将答案从西奈山传递给他呢？知识来源于权威，因此随着时间的流逝，它只会丧失，而不会增加。

当我第一次在（宗教）小学接触到“天使与驴子”的谚语时，我还不够成熟，无法成为一个彻底的无神论者，但我仍然心想：“托拉（犹太教教义）每一代都在失去知识，科学每一代都在获得知识。不管它们最初是从哪里开始的，迟早科学会超越托拉。”

最重要的是应该有进步。只要你不断前进，就一定能到达你的目的地；但如果你停下来，你永远也到达不了。

“Tsuyoku naritai”是日语。**Tsuyoku** 意为“强大”；**naru** 意为“成为”，“naritai”则是“想要成为”的意思。合起来意味着“我想变得更强”，并且在日本作品中，这种情感表现得比我读过的任何西方文学更加深刻。你可以在表达自己决心成为职业围棋选手时说这句话——或者在你输掉一场重要比赛后，但你并没有放弃——或者在你赢得一场重要比赛后，但你还不是九段棋手——或者在你成为历史上最伟大的围棋选手后，但你依然认为自己可以做得更好。这就是 **Tsuyoku naritai**，一种超越自我的意志。

每年在赎罪日（Yom Kippur），一个正统犹太人都会背诵一段悔过词，开头是“**Ashamnu**, **bagadnu**, **gazalnu**, \*\*dibarnu dofi”，并一直读到希伯来字母的最后一字：我们做了可耻的事，我们背叛了，我们偷窃了，我们诽谤了……

每念出一个字，你都会用手击打自己的心脏，以示悔过。没有例外，如果你整年没有偷窃，那么你也不能跳过“**gazalnu**”这一词，也不能少击打自己一次。这样做会违背赎罪日的共同精神——赎罪日是关于忏悔罪过的，而不是通过避免犯错来减少要忏悔的内容。

同样，**Ashamnu** 的结尾不会是：“但是那是今年，明年我会做得更好。”

**Ashamnu** 和理性之道有一个显著的相似之处，那就是，要做理性的人，你得像击打心脏一样，告诉自己：“我们都有偏见，我们都不理性，我们信息不完全，我们过于自信，我们的判断失准……”

好吧。现在告诉我，你打算如何变得更少偏见、更理性、更有信息、更少自信、更准确？

有一个老旧的犹太笑话：在赎罪日，拉比突然感到一阵强烈的罪恶感，俯伏下来哭喊：“上帝啊，在你面前我什么都不是！”会众领唱的歌手也被罪恶感冲击，哭喊：“上帝啊，在你面前我什么都不是！”看到这一幕，站在犹太教堂后面的清洁工也俯伏下来哭喊：“上帝啊，在你面前我什么都不是！”于是，拉比轻轻地碰了碰领唱的歌手，低声说：“看看谁以为自己什么都不是。”

不要因承认自己也有偏见而感到自豪；不要为自己自觉的缺点而沾沾自喜。这就像是不要为承认自己的无知而感到自豪；因为如果你的无知是你自豪的来源，那么当证据来临时，你可能不愿意放下你的无知。我们的缺点也一样——我们不该因承认它们而得意忘形；值得庆幸的是，当我们能有一些缺点不再需要忏悔时。

否则，当有人提出纠正偏见的计划时，我们会怒吼：“你是想把自己摆在我们之上吗？”我们会难过地摇头说：“你一定不够自知之明。”

除非你能告诉我你打算怎么做，否则不要对我说你和我一样有缺点。即使你之后依然会有很多缺点，但这并不是重点；重要的是要做得更好，要继续前进，要再迈出一步。**Tsuyoku naritai**！

## Tsuyoku Naritai! (I Want to Become Stronger)

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

In Orthodox Judaism there is a saying: “The previous generation is to the next one as angels are to men; the next generation is to the previous one as donkeys are to men.” This follows from the Orthodox Jewish belief that all Judaic law was given to Moses by God at Mount Sinai. After all, it’s not as if you could do an experiment to gain new halachic knowledge; the only way you can know is if someone tells you (who heard it from someone else, who heard it from God). Since there is no new source of information; it can only be degraded in transmission from generation to generation.

Thus, modern rabbis are not allowed to overrule ancient rabbis. Crawly things are ordinarily unkosher, but it is permissible to eat a worm found in an apple—the ancient rabbis believed the worm was spontaneously generated inside the apple, and therefore was part of the apple. A modern rabbi cannot say, “Yeah, well, the ancient rabbis knew diddly-squat about biology. Overruled!” A modern rabbi cannot possibly know a halachic principle the ancient rabbis did not, because how could the ancient rabbis have passed down the answer from Mount Sinai to him? Knowledge derives from authority, and therefore is only ever lost, not gained, as time passes.

When I was first exposed to the angels-and-donkeys proverb in (religious) elementary school, I was not old enough to be a full-blown atheist, but I still thought to myself: “Torah loses knowledge in every generation. Science gains knowledge with every generation. No matter where they started out, sooner or later science must surpass Torah.”

The most important thing is that there should be progress. So long as you keep moving forward you will reach your destination; but if you stop moving you will never reach it.

Tsuyoku naritai is Japanese. Tsuyoku is “strong”; naru is “becoming,” and the form naritai is “want to become.” Together it means, “I want to become stronger,” and it expresses a sentiment embodied more intensely in Japanese works than in any Western literature I’ve read. You might say it when expressing your determination to become a professional Go player—or after you lose an important match, but you haven’t given up—or after you win an important match, but you’re not a ninth-dan player yet—or after you’ve become the greatest Go player of all time, but you still think you can do better. That is tsuyoku naritai, the will to transcendence.

Each year on Yom Kippur, an Orthodox Jew recites a litany which begins Ashamnu, bagadnu, gazalnu, dibarnu dofi, and goes on through the entire Hebrew alphabet: We have acted shamefully, we have betrayed, we have stolen, we have slandered . . .

As you pronounce each word, you strike yourself over the heart in penitence. There’s no exemption whereby, if you manage to go without stealing all year long, you can skip the word gazalnu and strike yourself one less time. That would violate the community spirit of Yom Kippur, which is about confessing sins—not avoiding sins so that you have less to confess.

By the same token, the Ashamnu does not end, “But that was this year, and next year I will do better.”

The Ashamnu bears a remarkable resemblance to the notion that the way of rationality is to beat your fist against your heart and say, “We are all biased, we are all irrational, we are not fully informed, we are overconfident, we are poorly calibrated . . .”

Fine. Now tell me how you plan to become less biased, less irrational, more informed, less overconfident, better calibrated.

There is an old Jewish joke: During Yom Kippur, the rabbi is seized by a sudden wave of guilt, and prostrates himself and cries, “God, I am nothing before you!” The cantor is likewise seized by guilt, and cries, “God, I am nothing before you!” Seeing this, the janitor at the back of the synagogue prostrates himself and cries, “God, I am nothing before you!” And the rabbi nudges the cantor and whispers, “Look who thinks he’s nothing.”

Take no pride in your confession that you too are biased; do not glory in your self-awareness of your flaws. This is akin to the principle of not taking pride in confessing your ignorance; for if your ignorance is a source of pride to you, you may become loath to relinquish your ignorance when evidence comes knocking. Likewise with our flaws—we should not gloat over how self-aware we are for confessing them; the occasion for rejoicing is when we have a little less to confess.

Otherwise, when the one comes to us with a plan for correcting the bias, we will snarl, “Do you think to set yourself above us?” We will shake our heads sadly and say, “You must not be very self-aware.”

Never confess to me that you are just as flawed as I am unless you can tell me what you plan to do about it. Afterward you will still have plenty of flaws left, but that’s not the point; the important thing is to do better, to keep moving ahead, to take one more step forward. Tsuyoku naritai!
