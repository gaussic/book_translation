## 你的理性关乎我事

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

有人在回应《彩票：希望的浪费》时批评我，觉得我竟敢批评别人做出的选择；如果别人选择买彩票，我凭什么不同意？这其实是一个更普遍问题的特殊例子：如果别人选择相信让自己开心的事而非真相，那关我什么事？我们难道不能各自决定自己是否关心真相吗？

一个显而易见且犀利的反驳是：“你为什么在乎我是否在乎别人是否关心真相？”你的效用函数里包含了对别人效用函数又包含别人效用函数的负面项，这其实有点矛盾。但那只是犀利的反驳，不是真正的回答。

那么，我的回答是：作为一个人类，我认为我有理由且应当关心未来，关心人类文明将成为什么样子。其中一项重要的关切是人类对真理的追求，这种追求在世代中逐渐增强（因为科学并非从一开始就存在）。我希望在这一代中，进一步加强这种追求。这是我对未来的一个愿望。毕竟，无论我们是否接受责任，我们都在这张巨大棋盘上扮演着角色。

这就是为什么你的理性是我的事。

这是个危险的观点吗？是的，而且不只是“有点儿刺激”的危险。历史上有人被活活烧死，只因为某个神职人员决定他们的想法不正确。决定用火刑处死“想法不正确”的人——这是一种令人作呕的推理，不是吗？你肯定不希望有人那样想，那太恶心了。那些想法这样的人，嗯，我们得对他们做点什么……

我同意！我的建议是：我们可以反对坏观点，但不要用火烧人。

我们想避免的三段论是：“我认为苏西说了错话，所以苏西应该被火烧死。”有些人试图避免这种三段论，方法是说认为苏西说了错话本身就是不合适的。没人该评判任何人；任何评判他人的人都是罪人，应该被公开羞辱。

至于我，我否认“所以”的结论。我的三段论是：“我认为苏西说错了，所以我会反驳她的观点，但不会烧她，或用暴力或规章阻止她说话……”

我们都在这张巨大棋盘上，而我对未来的一个期望是让游戏公平。科学背后的反直觉理念是，事实上的分歧应通过实验和数学解决，而非暴力和命令。这一不可思议的理念可以推广到科学之外，成为整个未来公平竞争的基石。你应该通过说服人们来赢得胜利，而不应允许你去烧人。这是理性的原则之一，我为之效忠。

那些主张相对主义或利己主义的人，在我看来，并不是真正的相对主义者或利己主义者。如果真是相对主义，他们就不会评判他人；如果真是利己主义，他们就会专注赚钱，而不是热衷于与人辩论。相反，他们选择了相对主义这边，目标是在这巨大棋盘上阻止所有玩家作出某些判断。或者他们选择了利己主义这边，目标是让所有玩家都变得利己。然后他们按照自己的智慧公平或不公平地玩这场游戏。

如果有真正的相对主义者或利己主义者，我们听不到他们的声音——他们保持沉默，不参与游戏。

我无法不关心你的思考方式，因为——正如我无法不去看见宇宙——每当一个人远离真相，人类展开的故事就暗淡一点。在很多情况下，这只是一点小黑暗。（并非每次都会有人受伤。）在自己心里自欺欺人，比起公开撒谎或活活烧人，对人类历史的阴影要小得多。但我内心仍会为此感到哀伤。只要我不试图用火烧你——只与您的观点辩论——我相信，作为一个人，关心我的同类是对的、合适的。这也是我为未来辩护的立场。

## Your Rationality Is My Business

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Some responses to “Lotteries: A Waste of Hope” chided me for daring to criticize others’ decisions; if someone else chooses to buy lottery tickets, who am I to disagree? This is a special case of a more general question: What business is it of mine, if someone else chooses to believe what is pleasant rather than what is true? Can’t we each choose for ourselves whether to care about the truth?

An obvious snappy comeback is: “Why do you care whether I care whether someone else cares about the truth?” It is somewhat inconsistent for your utility function to contain a negative term for anyone else’s utility function having a term for someone else’s utility function. But that is only a snappy comeback, not an answer.

So here then is my answer: I believe that it is right and proper for me, as a human being, to have an interest in the future, and what human civilization becomes in the future. One of those interests is the human pursuit of truth, which has strengthened slowly over the generations (for there was not always Science). I wish to strengthen that pursuit further, in this generation. That is a wish of mine, for the Future. For we are all of us players upon that vast gameboard, whether we accept the responsibility or not.

And that makes your rationality my business.

Is this a dangerous idea? Yes, and not just pleasantly edgy “dangerous.” People have been burned to death because some priest decided that they didn’t think the way they should. Deciding to burn people to death because they “don’t think properly”—that’s a revolting kind of reasoning, isn’t it? You wouldn’t want people to think that way, why, it’s disgusting. People who think like that, well, we’ll have to do something about them . . .

I agree! Here’s my proposal: Let’s argue against bad ideas but not set their bearers on fire.

The syllogism we desire to avoid runs: “I think Susie said a bad thing, therefore, Susie should be set on fire.” Some try to avoid the syllogism by labeling it improper to think that Susie said a bad thing. No one should judge anyone, ever; anyone who judges is committing a terrible sin, and should be publicly pilloried for it.

As for myself, I deny the therefore. My syllogism runs, “I think Susie said something wrong, therefore, I will argue against what she said, but I will not set her on fire, or try to stop her from talking by violence or regulation . . .”

We are all of us players upon that vast gameboard; and one of my interests for the Future is to make the game fair. The counterintuitive idea underlying science is that factual disagreements should be fought out with experiments and mathematics, not violence and edicts. This incredible notion can be extended beyond science, to a fair fight for the whole Future. You should have to win by convincing people, and should not be allowed to burn them. This is one of the principles of Rationality, to which I have pledged my allegiance.

People who advocate relativism or selfishness do not appear to me to be truly relativistic or selfish. If they were really relativistic, they would not judge. If they were really selfish, they would get on with making money instead of arguing passionately with others. Rather, they have chosen the side of Relativism, whose goal upon that vast gameboard is to prevent the players—all the players—from making certain kinds of judgments. Or they have chosen the side of Selfishness, whose goal is to make all players selfish. And then they play the game, fairly or unfairly according to their wisdom.

If there are any true Relativists or Selfishes, we do not hear them—they remain silent, non-players.

I cannot help but care how you think, because—as I cannot help but see the universe—each time a human being turns away from the truth, the unfolding story of humankind becomes a little darker. In many cases, it is a small darkness only. (Someone doesn’t always end up getting hurt.) Lying to yourself, in the privacy of your own thoughts, does not shadow humanity’s history so much as telling public lies or setting people on fire. Yet there is a part of me which cannot help but mourn. And so long as I don’t try to set you on fire—only argue with your ideas—I believe that it is right and proper to me, as a human, that I care about my fellow humans. That, also, is a position I defend into the Future.
