## 新改良彩票

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

人们仍然在建议说，彩票并不是在浪费希望，而是一种提供幻想的服务——“花比看电影幻想与好莱坞明星恋爱少得多的钱，就能做一场变成百万富翁的白日梦。”<sup>1</sup>
有一位评论者写道：“在成为富有这件事上，零概率和一个极小概率之间有很大的区别。买一张彩票，让你的致富梦想跨越了那道鸿沟。”

事实上，我想表达的一个观点正是：在“零概率”和“一个极小概率”之间，差的并不是一点点，而是数量级上的差距。如果你对此表示怀疑，那就假设这个极小概率是 1/Googolplex（一后面跟着 10 的 Googol 次方个零）。

不过，如果我们假装彩票确实售卖的是“极小的希望”，那这就启发了一种新改良彩票的设计思路。
这个新改良彩票平均每五年开奖一次，时间是随机的——比如由某种放射性不强的元素的衰变来决定开奖时刻。你只需花一美元买一次，就能获得几年的致富希望，而不仅仅是几天。不仅如此，这种致富可能会在任何时刻发生！每一分钟，电话铃响起，都有可能是通知你成为百万富翁的时刻！

想想看，这要比普通的彩票有趣得多，后者只在每周规定的几个时间点开奖。假设老板走进办公室，要求你重做提案、补货或做些其他烦人的工作。与其动手工作，你可以转头看向电话，盯着它，希望它响起——因为你有极小但不为零的机会，在那一刻，你，就是你，会赢得头奖！
即便这一分钟没中奖，也没必要失望——下一分钟就有可能发生！

想象一下，这个新改良彩票能让你做多少种幻想。你可以去商店购物，往购物车里加一些昂贵的商品——如果你的彩票中奖电话没打来，大不了再把东西放回去，对吧？

也许这个新改良彩票还能展示一个不断变化的概率分布，显示中奖发生的可能性，以及特定号码被选中的可能性，这种概率最终会趋向一个泊松分布（Poisson distribution）。想象一下那得多有趣！哇，此刻中奖的几率比平时高出近十倍！而我选的那个 42 号球的中奖概率也翻了一倍！你可以把这些数据实时展示在人们的手机屏幕上，他们只需打开手机，就能看到自己的中奖概率。
想想看这会有多刺激！比对账本有趣多了！比做作业刺激多了！这个新幻想如此诱人，它不仅能取代“去技术学校”的希望，甚至能取代“早点下班回家”的愿望。人们整天盯着手机屏幕就够了，根本不需要做别的梦！

没错，给人们提供一些永远不会成真的诱人幻想，这确实是一项“有价值”的服务。人们愿意为此付钱，它就一定有价值。
另一种可能性是：消费者其实在犯错误——可我们都知道，这种事情是不可能发生的，对吧？

然而现实中，现有的政府掌握着彩票的卑劣垄断，却并不提供这种简单而显而易见的服务。为什么？因为他们想多收费。他们想让人们每周都掏钱，让他们花上一百美元，只为获得一种错觉：自己中奖的概率增加了一百倍。而不是能够坐在手机前静静等待概率陡增的一刻。
所以，如果你相信彩票是一项服务，那么显然这是一项严重溢价的服务——而费用是让社会中最贫穷的群体来承担的。
因此，作为公民，你的神圣职责，就是呼吁推出这个新改良彩票来取而代之。

## New Improved Lottery

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

People are still suggesting that the lottery is not a waste of hope, but a service which enables purchase of fantasy—“daydreaming about becoming a millionaire for much less money than daydreaming about hollywood stars in movies.”<sup>1</sup> One commenter wrote: “There is a big difference between zero chance of becoming wealthy, and epsilon. Buying a ticket allows your dream of riches to bridge that gap.”

Actually, one of the points I was trying to make is that between zero chance of becoming wealthy, and epsilon chance, there is an order-ofepsilon difference. If you doubt this, let epsilon equal one over googolplex.

Anyway, if we pretend that the lottery sells epsilon hope, this suggests a design for a New Improved Lottery. The New Improved Lottery pays out every five years on average, at a random time—determined, say, by the decay of a not-very-radioactive element. You buy in once, for a single dollar, and get not just a few days of epsilon chance of becoming rich, but a few years of epsilon. Not only that, your wealth could strike at any time! At any minute, the phone could ring to inform you that you, yes, you are a millionaire!

Think of how much better this would be than an ordinary lottery drawing, which only takes place at defined times, a few times per week. Let’s say the boss comes in and demands you rework a proposal, or restock inventory, or something similarly annoying. Instead of getting to work, you could turn to the phone and stare, hoping for that call—because there would be epsilon chance that, at that exact moment, you yes you would be awarded the Grand Prize! And even if it doesn’t happen this minute, why, there’s no need to be disappointed—it might happen the next minute!

Think of how many more fantasies this New Improved Lottery would enable. You could shop at the store, adding expensive items to your shopping cart—if your cellphone doesn’t ring with news of a lottery win, you could always put the items back, right?

Maybe the New Improved Lottery could even show a constantly fluctuating probability distribution over the likelihood of a win occurring, and the likelihood of particular numbers being selected, with the overall expectation working out to the aforesaid Poisson distribution. Think of how much fun that would be! Oh, goodness, right this minute the chance of a win occurring is nearly ten times higher than usual! And look, the number 42 that I selected for the Mega Ball has nearly twice the usual chance of winning! You could feed it to a display on people’s cellphones, so they could just flip open the cellphone and see their chances of winning. Think of how exciting that would be! Much more exciting than trying to balance your checkbook! Much more exciting than doing your homework! This new dream would be so much tastier that it would compete with, not only hopes of going to technical school, but even hopes of getting home from work early. People could just stay glued to the screen all day long, why, they wouldn’t need to dream about anything else!

Yep, offering people tempting daydreams that will not actually happen sure is a valuable service, all right. People are willing to pay; it must be valuable. The alternative is that consumers are making mistakes, and we all know that can’t happen.

And yet current governments, with their vile monopoly on lotteries, don’t offer this simple and obvious service. Why? Because they want to overcharge people. They want them to spend money every week. They want them to spend a hundred dollars for the thrill of believing their chance of winning is a hundred times as large, instead of being able to stare at a cellphone screen waiting for the likelihood to spike. So if you believe that the lottery is a service, it is clearly an enormously overpriced service— charged to the poorest members of society—and it is your solemn duty as a citizen to demand the New Improved Lottery instead.
