## 第三种选择

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

“相信圣诞老人能给孩子们带来一种奇妙的感觉，并鼓励他们表现良好，以期收到礼物。如果真相摧毁了他们对圣诞老人的信仰，孩子们将失去这种奇妙的感觉，也不再乖乖听话。因此，尽管相信圣诞老人并不符合事实，但它是一种‘高尚的谎言’，出于功利主义的理由，其总体利益应当被保留。”

传统上，这被称为**错误两难选择**，也叫**排中谬误**或**捆绑包谬误**（package-deal fallacy）。即使我们接受上述论点中的事实前提和道德前提，这个论证也不成立。即便假设“圣诞政策”（鼓励孩子相信圣诞老人）比“无作为政策”（什么也不做）更好，也并不意味着“圣诞主义”是所有可能政策中最优的。还有其他方式可以给孩子们带来奇妙感，比如带他们观看航天飞机发射，或者给他们科幻小说。同样地，用贿赂来换取孩子们的好行为，只会让他们在大人看着的时候才表现好；而单纯的表扬更容易引导出无条件的良好行为。

“高尚的谎言”通常是捆绑包谬误。而应对这种谬误的方式是：如果我们真的需要那种所谓的“好处”，我们应当设法构造**第三种选择**来获得它。

我们该如何找到第三种选择？第一步是**决定去寻找**，最后一步是**决定去接受**。这听起来很显然，但大多数人恰恰是在这两个环节上失败了，而不是在实际的搜索过程中。

有些错误两难是诚实地产生的，因为更优的替代方案从认知上很难看见。但还有一种制造错误两难的方式是：为了证明一个有问题的政策是正当的，就去强调它相较于“什么都不做”有某种好处。在这种情况下，提出这种论点的人并不**想要**一个第三选择；一旦找到第三种选择，他们的理由就不成立了。支持圣诞主义的人最不想听到的，恐怕就是“表扬比贿赂更有效”或者“太空飞船也能像会飞的驯鹿一样激发想象”。

**“最好”往往是“好”的敌人。** 如果我们的目标真的是为了帮助他人，那么发现更优的替代策略本应是一件值得庆祝的事——因为它能让我们更有效地帮助他人。但如果我们的目标其实是**想为某种特定策略辩护**，假称其“有益于他人”，那么第三选择反而成了敌人的论点，一种威胁。

现代认知心理学认为决策过程就是一种对选择方案的搜索。在现实生活中，光是比较现有的选项还不够，你得**先创造出这些选项**。很多问题上，可供选择的方案数量庞大，所以你需要一个停止搜索的标准。比如买房时，你不可能看遍全城的每一套房子，总得在某个时候停止搜索并做决定。

但如果我们的**显意识动机**（即我们愿意承认的标准）和**潜意识动机**不一致，会怎样？比如，当我们假装是在“为他人谋福利”地寻找政策方案，但某种方案虽然能让他人受益，却对我们自己不利——我们就不会在那儿停下，而是继续“寻找”，自我催眠说我们在找“更利他的方案”。但假如某种策略既能带来“可辩护的好处”，又恰好对自己有利，我们就会**立刻停止搜索**！事实上，我们很可能会抗拒任何建议我们重新搜索的提议——可能会说“没时间了”。（不过说来也奇怪，我们似乎总有精力为当前策略找理由。）

\*\*当你发现自己在为一个“尚可接受”的政策辩护，而不是追求“最优”策略时，要当心；\*\*或者你只是指出该政策相较于“什么都不做”有些许好处，而不是所有可能策略中最好的一种，也要警惕。

错误两难常被用来为某些“不道德但极其便利”的政策辩护。例如，撒谎通常比说实话更省事；而坚持原有信念也比改变信念更省力。因此，“高尚的谎言”论点广受欢迎，因为它能为既有信仰提供防护——你不会发现有人去计算一个“最优的新高尚谎言”；他们只是坚持原先那个谎言。赶紧终止搜索才是上策！

要想做得更好，你得直截了当地问自己：**如果我看到某个替代策略比当前政策更优，我在内心深处会感到高兴，还是会有一丝不情愿才放手？**
如果你的答案是“不会高兴”和“会有点不舍”，那你可能根本没去认真寻找第三种选择。

这引出另一个值得直接问自己的问题：**我有没有真正花五分钟闭上眼睛、天马行空地思考、尽可能地头脑风暴、试图想出一个更好的替代方案？**
这得是真的五分钟，不然你只会眨下眼，再睁开，然后说：“嗯，我是有想过其他选择的，但没啥更好的。”——“眨眼”就是人们逃避责任的完美黑洞。建议你用一个真实的计时器。

而那些“天马行空的方案”——你有没有**故意避免想出一个好点子**？你的内心深处是不是在悄悄确保你想到的每一个选项看起来都不靠谱？

令人震惊的是，有那么多“高尚的说谎者”和类似的人，乐意去践踏伦理（尽管他们会哀叹这违背良心），但他们甚至连五分钟的时间都没花在寻找替代方案上。有些思维搜索，我们其实暗暗希望它失败；一旦成功的前景令人不适，人们便会抓住一切借口尽早放弃。

## The Third Alternative

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

“Believing in Santa Claus gives children a sense of wonder and encourages them to behave well in hope of receiving presents. If Santa-belief is destroyed by truth, the children will lose their sense of wonder and stop behaving nicely. Therefore, even though Santa-belief is false-to-fact, it is a Noble Lie whose net benefit should be preserved for utilitarian reasons.”

Classically, this is known as a false dilemma, the fallacy of the excluded middle, or the package-deal fallacy. Even if we accept the underlying factual and moral premises of the above argument, it does not carry through. Even supposing that the Santa policy (encourage children to believe in Santa Claus) is better than the null policy (do nothing), it does not follow that Santa-ism is the best of all possible alternatives. Other policies could also supply children with a sense of wonder, such as taking them to watch a Space Shuttle launch or supplying them with science fiction novels. Likewise, offering children bribes for good behavior encourages the children to behave well only when adults are watching, while praise without bribes leads to unconditional good behavior.

Noble Lies are generally package-deal fallacies; and the response to a package-deal fallacy is that if we really need the supposed gain, we can construct a Third Alternative for getting it.

How can we obtain Third Alternatives? The first step in obtaining a Third Alternative is deciding to look for one, and the last step is the decision to accept it. This sounds obvious, and yet most people fail on these two steps, rather than within the search process.

Some false dilemmas arise honestly, because superior alternatives are cognitively hard to see. But one factory for false dilemmas is justifying a questionable policy by pointing to a supposed benefit over the null action. In this case, the justifier does not want a Third Alternative; finding a Third Alternative would destroy the justification. The last thing a Santa-ist wants to hear is that praise works better than bribes, or that spaceships can be as inspiring as flying reindeer.

The best is the enemy of the good. If the goal is really to help people, then a superior alternative is cause for celebration—once we find this better strategy, we can help people more effectively. But if the goal is to justify a particular strategy by claiming that it helps people, a Third Alternative is an enemy argument, a competitor.

Modern cognitive psychology views decision-making as a search for alternatives. In real life, it’s not enough to compare options; you have to generate the options in the first place. On many problems, the number of alternatives is huge, so you need a stopping criterion for the search. When you’re looking to buy a house, you can’t compare every house in the city; at some point you have to stop looking and decide.

But what about when our conscious motives for the search—the criteria we can admit to ourselves—don’t square with subconscious influences? When we are carrying out an allegedly altruistic search, a search for an altruistic policy, and we find a strategy that benefits others but disadvantages ourselves—well, we don’t stop looking there; we go on looking. Telling ourselves that we’re looking for a strategy that brings greater altruistic benefit, of course. But suppose we find a policy that has some defensible benefit, and also just happens to be personally convenient? Then we stop the search at once! In fact, we’ll probably resist any suggestion that we start looking again—pleading lack of time, perhaps. (And yet somehow, we always have cognitive resources for coming up with justifications for our current policy.)

Beware when you find yourself arguing that a policy is defensible rather than optimal; or that it has some benefit compared to the null action, rather than the best benefit of any action.

False dilemmas are often presented to justify unethical policies that are, by some vast coincidence, very convenient. Lying, for example, is often much more convenient than telling the truth; and believing whatever you started out with is more convenient than updating. Hence the popularity of arguments for Noble Lies; it serves as a defense of a pre-existing belief—one does not find Noble Liars who calculate an optimal new Noble Lie; they keep whatever lie they started with. Better stop that search fast!

To do better, ask yourself straight out: If I saw that there was a superior alternative to my current policy, would I be glad in the depths of my heart, or would I feel a tiny flash of reluctance before I let go? If the answers are “no” and “yes,” beware that you may not have searched for a Third Alternative.

Which leads into another good question to ask yourself straight out: Did I spend five minutes with my eyes closed, brainstorming wild and creative options, trying to think of a better alternative? It has to be five minutes by the clock, because otherwise you blink—close your eyes and open them again—and say, “Why, yes, I searched for alternatives, but there weren’t any.” Blinking makes a good black hole down which to dump your duties. An actual, physical clock is recommended.

And those wild and creative options—were you careful not to think of a good one? Was there a secret effort from the corner of your mind to ensure that every option considered would be obviously bad?

It’s amazing how many Noble Liars and their ilk are eager to embrace ethical violations—with all due bewailing of their agonies of conscience—when they haven’t spent even five minutes by the clock looking for an alternative. There are some mental searches that we secretly wish would fail; and when the prospect of success is uncomfortable, people take the earliest possible excuse to give up.
