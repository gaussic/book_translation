## 如何说服我相信 2 + 2 = 3

**作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky**

在《[什么是证据？](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality/what-is-evidence)》一文中，我写道：<sup>1</sup>

> 这就是为什么理性主义者如此看重这样一个看似矛盾的观点：**一个信念只有在你原则上可以被说服相信相反的情况下才真正有价值**。如果无论什么样的光进入你的视网膜，视网膜最终都会处于相同的状态，那么你就是**盲人**……于是有了“盲目信仰”这个词。如果你的信念不取决于你所看到的东西，那你就和被人挖掉眼睛一样彻底失明。

Cihan Baran 回应说：<sup>2</sup>

> 我无法想象有什么情境能让 2 + 2 = 4 成为假的。也许正因为如此，我对“2 + 2 = 4”的信仰是无条件的。

我承认，我也无法想象有什么“情境”能让 2 + 2 = 4 成为假命题。（确实可以重新定义术语，但那就不是“情境”，而是你已经不在讨论 2、4、= 或 + 了。）但这并不意味着我的信念是无条件的。我其实很容易就能想象出一个情境，会让我相信 2 + 2 = 3。

比如说，假设我早上起床，拿出两个耳塞，放在床头柜上另外两个耳塞旁边，然后注意到现在总共有**三个耳塞**——没有任何耳塞消失或出现——这与我记忆中“2 + 2 应该等于 4”的认知相冲突。而当我在脑中想象这个过程时，似乎将 “xx” 与 “xx” 合并成 “xxxx” 需要额外一个“x”凭空出现，这又和我在脑中想象的其他算术运算不一致。比如，“xxx - xx = x”，但“xxxx - xx = xx”。这将与我记忆中“3 - 2 = 1”的认知冲突，但面对身体和心理上的证据确认“xxx - xx = xx”，我会觉得自己的记忆荒谬可笑。

我也会检查一下计算器，查一下谷歌，甚至翻出我那本《1984》，书中温斯顿写道：“自由，就是说出二加二等于三的自由。”这些途径大概率都会告诉我，全世界都认同我目前所见到的现象，并反对我记忆中“2 + 2 = 4”的说法。

我会怎么想自己竟然曾经相信 2 + 2 = 4 呢？我可能会得出两个解释：第一，是某种神经系统的故障（比如打喷嚏时出错）导致我记忆中所有的加法运算结果都多加了一；第二，是有人在搞我，不管是通过催眠，还是我其实是一个被操控的计算机模拟体。在第二种情况下，我更倾向于认为是**我的算术记忆被篡改**，而不是“2 + 2 实际上等于 4”。这两种貌似合理的解释都不会阻止我意识到：**我非常非常非常困惑**。<sup>3</sup>

换句话说，说服我“2 + 2 = 3”的证据类型，与现在说服我“2 + 2 = 4”的证据是**同一类型的**：物理观察、心智可视化和社会共识之间的交叉验证。

我小时候并不知道“2 + 2 = 4”。我之所以后来形成了这个信念，并不是出于随机过程——否则我大脑里也可能记下“2 + 2 = 7”。但大脑居然记住了“2 + 2 = 4”，这一点惊人地与我把两个耳塞放到另两个耳塞旁边时的实际观测结果相一致，这种**心智与现实之间的镜像**关系，需要一个解释：**是某种纠缠（entanglement）机制产生了这种同步**。

一个关于事实的信念只有两种可能：要么是通过与现实纠缠的过程产生的，要么不是。如果不是，那这个信念**只能是碰巧正确**。对于任何内部复杂度稍微高一些的信念（比如模拟这个信念需要的计算程序超过 10 位），可能性空间就大到足以让“碰巧正确”的概率趋近于零。<sup>4</sup>

无条件的“事实”与无条件的“信仰”并不是一回事。如果有纠缠的证据让我相信某个事实是无条件的，这并不意味着我**一直以来**都在无条件地相信它。

我相信“2 + 2 = 4”，同时我也很容易设想出一个能让我相信“2 + 2 = 3”的情境。这个情境本质上与让我现在相信“2 + 2 = 4”的情境**是一样的**。因此，我不担心自己是盲目信仰的受害者。<sup>5</sup>

<sup>5</sup> 如果有了解贝叶斯定理的基督徒读者，我想问一句：\*\*有什么情境能说服你相信伊斯兰教是真的？\*\*也许答案就是与你现在成为基督徒的原因相同的那种情境：我们把你从一个穆斯林妇女的子宫里拉出来，让你由穆斯林父母抚养长大，他们不断地告诉你，“无条件地相信伊斯兰是善良的”。

或者说，除了这个，还有别的因素？如果有，那又是什么样的情境能说服你相信伊斯兰，或者至少不再是基督徒？你又有多大的信心，相信自己现在所依赖的证据和推理方式，**在你被养成穆斯林的情况下**，仍足以让你否定宗教信仰？

## How to Convince Me That 2 + 2 = 3

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

In “[What is Evidence?](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality/what-is-evidence)” I wrote:<sup>1</sup>

> This is why rationalists put such a heavy premium on the paradoxical-seeming claim that a belief is only really worthwhile if you could, in principle, be persuaded to believe otherwise. If your retina ended up in the same state regardless of what light entered it, you would be blind . . . Hence the phrase, “blind faith.” If what you believe doesn’t depend on what you see, you’ve been blinded as effectively as by poking out your eyeballs.

Cihan Baran replied:<sup>2</sup>

> I can not conceive of a situation that would make 2 + 2 = 4 false. Perhaps for that reason, my belief in 2 + 2 = 4 is unconditional.

I admit, I cannot conceive of a “situation” that would make 2 + 2 = 4 false. (There are redefinitions, but those are not “situations,” and then you’re no longer talking about 2, 4, =, or +.) But that doesn’t make my belief unconditional. I find it quite easy to imagine a situation which would convince me that 2 + 2 = 3.

Suppose I got up one morning, and took out two earplugs, and set them down next to two other earplugs on my nighttable, and noticed that there were now three earplugs, without any earplugs having appeared or disappeared—in contrast to my stored memory that 2 + 2 was supposed to equal 4. Moreover, when I visualized the process in my own mind, it seemed that making xx and xx come out to xxxx required an extra x to appear from nowhere, and was, moreover, inconsistent with other arithmetic I visualized, since subtracting xx from xxx left xx, but subtracting xx from xxxx left xxx. This would conflict with my stored memory that 3 - 2 = 1, but memory would be absurd in the face of physical and mental confirmation that xxx - xx = xx.

I would also check a pocket calculator, Google, and perhaps my copy of 1984 where Winston writes that “Freedom is the freedom to say two plus two equals three.” All of these would naturally show that the rest of the world agreed with my current visualization, and disagreed with my memory, that 2 + 2 = 3.

How could I possibly have ever been so deluded as to believe that 2 + 2 = 4? Two explanations would come to mind: First, a neurological fault (possibly caused by a sneeze) had made all the additive sums in my stored memory go up by one. Second, someone was messing with me, by hypnosis or by my being a computer simulation. In the second case, I would think it more likely that they had messed with my arithmetic recall than that 2 + 2 actually equalled 4. Neither of these plausible-sounding explanations would prevent me from noticing that I was very, very, very confused.<sup>3</sup>

What would convince me that 2 + 2 = 3, in other words, is exactly the same kind of evidence that currently convinces me that 2 + 2 = 4: The evidential crossfire of physical observation, mental visualization, and social agreement.

There was a time when I had no idea that 2 + 2 = 4. I did not arrive at this new belief by random processes—then there would have been no particular reason for my brain to end up storing “2 + 2 = 4” instead of “2 + 2 = 7.” The fact that my brain stores an answer surprisingly similar to what happens when I lay down two earplugs alongside two earplugs, calls forth an explanation of what entanglement produces this strange mirroring of mind and reality.

There’s really only two possibilities, for a belief of fact—either the belief got there via a mind-reality entangling process, or not. If not, the belief can’t be correct except by coincidence. For beliefs with the slightest shred of internal complexity (requiring a computer program of more than 10 bits to simulate), the space of possibilities is large enough that coincidence vanishes.<sup>4</sup>

Unconditional facts are not the same as unconditional beliefs. If entangled evidence convinces me that a fact is unconditional, this doesn’t mean I always believed in the fact without need of entangled evidence.

I believe that 2 + 2 = 4, and I find it quite easy to conceive of a situation which would convince me that 2 + 2 = 3. Namely, the same sort of situation that currently convinces me that 2 + 2 = 4. Thus I do not fear that I am a victim of blind faith.<sup>5</sup>

<sup>5</sup>If there are any Christians reading this who know Bayes’s Theorem, might I inquire of you what situation would convince you of the truth of Islam? Presumably it would be the same sort of situation causally responsible for producing your current belief in Christianity: We would push you screaming out of the uterus of a Muslim woman, and have you raised by Muslim parents who continually told you that it is good to believe unconditionally in Islam.

Or is there more to it than that? If so, what situation would convince you of Islam, or at least, non-Christianity? And how confident are you that the general kinds of evidence and reasoning you appeal to would have been enough to dissuade you of your religion if you had been raised a Muslim?
