## Tsuyoku 与 平等本能

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

狩猎采集部落通常高度崇尚平等（至少对男性来说如此）——那种拥有至高无上权力的部落酋长，多见于农业社会，极少出现在人类祖先赖以生存的环境中。在大多数狩猎采集部落中，一位猎人若猎得战果丰硕，通常会刻意淡化其成就，以避免引发他人的嫉妒。

也许，如果你起点低于平均水平，可以在不冒险超越大众的前提下提升自己。但迟早，如果你真心想做到最好，就会把目标设定在平均线之上。

如果你无法承认自己做得比他人更好——或者你为渴望优于他人而感到羞耻——那么“中位数”将永远是你面前的一堵混凝土墙，成为你停止前进的地方。那么，那些本来就处于平均线以下的人呢？你敢说你想做得比他们好吗？你太自大了吧！

也许，把优于他人当成一种骄傲并不健康。但就我个人而言，尽管有违原则，这种念头确实为我带来了实实在在的动力，而我愿意接受一切对我有用的动力。也许这种竞争是零和游戏，但围棋也是零和的；那并不意味着我们应该废除这种人类活动，只要它有趣，并能带我们通往某个更深刻的地方。

但无论如何，因做得更好而感到羞耻，肯定是不健康的。

而且，人生并不是按曲线打分的（即：没有“按平均分调整”）。超越的意志并没有某个点会突然停止，变成“堕落的意志”；而那种没有终点线的赛跑，也就没有金牌或银牌。你只需尽你所能地奔跑，不必担心是否超越了其他赛跑者。（但请注意：如果你拒绝担心这种可能性，那么某一天你可能真的会超越他们。如果你忽视后果，它们可能就会降临在你身上。）

迟早，如果你走的是一条正道，你将开始改正一个大多数人尚未改正的缺陷。迟早，如果你的努力结出了果实，你会发现自己已没那么多罪要忏悔了。

也许，你会明智地选择淡化自己的成就，即便你已成功。人们或许能原谅你达阵，但未必会原谅你在达阵区跳舞庆祝。你很快就会发现，公开否认自己的价值、假装自己和其他人一样有缺陷，要更迅速、更轻松、更便利——只要每个人都“心知肚明”那不是真的就好。自豪地展现自己的谦逊，也是一种乐趣，前提是大家都知道你确实有许多值得谦逊的地方。

但别让这一切成为你旅程的终点。即使只是对自己低语，也请低语道：

**Tsuyoku, tsuyoku! 强者，更强！**

然后，再设定一个更高的目标。这才是真正意识到“我仍然有缺陷”（尽管少了一些）的含义——意味着你将始终向更高处迈进，无需感到羞耻。

**Tsuyoku naritai！（我想变强！）**
我会一直尽我所能地奔跑，即使我领先了，也会继续奔跑；总有一天，有人会超过我；但即使我落后了，我仍将一直全力奔跑。

## Tsuyoku vs. the Egalitarian Instinct

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Hunter-gatherer tribes are usually highly egalitarian (at least if you’re male)—the all-powerful tribal chieftain is found mostly in agricultural societies, rarely in the ancestral environment. Among most hunter-gatherer tribes, a hunter who brings in a spectacular kill will carefully downplay the accomplishment to avoid envy.

Maybe, if you start out below average, you can improve yourself without daring to pull ahead of the crowd. But sooner or later, if you aim to do the best you can, you will set your aim above the average.

If you can’t admit to yourself that you’ve done better than others—or if you’re ashamed of wanting to do better than others—then the median will forever be your concrete wall, the place where you stop moving forward. And what about people who are below average? Do you dare say you intend to do better than them? How prideful of you!

Maybe it’s not healthy to pride yourself on doing better than someone else. Personally I’ve found it to be a useful motivator, despite my principles, and I’ll take all the useful motivation I can get. Maybe that kind of competition is a zero-sum game, but then so is Go; it doesn’t mean we should abolish that human activity, if people find it fun and it leads somewhere interesting.

But in any case, surely it isn’t healthy to be ashamed of doing better.

And besides, life is not graded on a curve. The will to transcendence has no point beyond which it ceases and becomes the will to do worse; and the race that has no finish line also has no gold or silver medals. Just run as fast as you can, without worrying that you might pull ahead of other runners. (But be warned: If you refuse to worry about that possibility, someday you may pull ahead. If you ignore the consequences, they may happen to you.)

Sooner or later, if your path leads true, you will set out to mitigate a flaw that most people have not mitigated. Sooner or later, if your efforts bring forth any fruit, you will find yourself with fewer sins to confess.

Perhaps you will find it the course of wisdom to downplay the accomplishment, even if you succeed. People may forgive a touchdown, but not dancing in the end zone. You will certainly find it quicker, easier, more convenient to publicly disclaim your worthiness, to pretend that you are just as much a sinner as everyone else. Just so long, of course, as everyone knows it isn’t true. It can be fun to proudly display your modesty, so long as everyone knows how very much you have to be modest about.

But do not let that be the endpoint of your journeys. Even if you only whisper it to yourself, whisper it still: Tsuyoku, tsuyoku! Stronger, stronger!

And then set yourself a higher target. That’s the true meaning of the realization that you are still flawed (though a little less so). It means always reaching higher, without shame.

Tsuyoku naritai! I’ll always run as fast as I can, even if I pull ahead, I’ll keep on running; and someone, someday, will surpass me; but even though I fall behind, I’ll always run as fast as I can.
