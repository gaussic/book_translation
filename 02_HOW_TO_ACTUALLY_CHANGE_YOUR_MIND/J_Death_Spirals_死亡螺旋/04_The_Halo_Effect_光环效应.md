## 光环效应

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

情感启发式（*affect heuristic*）是指一种总体上的好恶感，会对许多其他判断产生影响，无论这种影响是否合乎逻辑，也无论你是否意识到它。比如，当被试者被告知核能的好处时，他们往往也会认为其风险更低；股票分析师在评价不熟悉的股票时，也倾向于将其视为“总体不错”或“总体糟糕”——低风险高回报，或高风险低回报——这违背了经济学的基本理论，即风险和回报应呈正相关。

光环效应（*halo effect*）是情感启发式在社会心理学中的体现。Robert Cialdini 总结道：<sup>1</sup>

> 研究表明，我们会自动将好看的个体赋予诸如有才华、善良、诚实和聪明等正面特质（相关证据综述见 Eagly、Ashmore、Makhijani 和 Longo，1991）。而且，我们在做出这些判断时，并未意识到外貌吸引力在其中发挥了作用。
>
> 这种无意识的“好看=好人”假设的后果令人担忧。例如，一项针对1974年加拿大联邦大选的研究发现，长相吸引人的候选人获得的选票是长相不吸引人的候选人的两倍半（Efran 和 Patterson，1976）。尽管有这种对貌美政客的偏好，后续研究发现选民并未意识到自己的偏见。事实上，被调查的加拿大选民中，有73%以最强烈的措辞否认其投票受到外貌影响；只有14%的人承认可能存在这种影响（Efran 和 Patterson，1976）。选民们尽可以否认外貌对当选几率的影响，但证据却持续显示它的确存在（Budesheim 和 DePaola，1994）。
>
> 在招聘情境中也发现了类似效应。在一项模拟面试的研究中，申请者的仪表整洁程度比其工作资历对雇用决定的影响更大——即便面试官声称外表因素影响很小（Mack 和 Rainey，1990）。这种对外貌吸引人的员工的偏好从入职日延续到发薪日。经济学家在美加两国的样本中发现，外表吸引人的人平均比不吸引人的同事多赚12%至14%的工资（Hamermesh 和 Biddle，1994）。
>
> 同样令人不安的是，研究还表明我们的司法体系也容易受到外貌和体型结构的影响。现在看来，外表吸引人的人更有可能在法律系统中受到有利对待（综述见 Castellow、Wuensch 和 Moore，1991；以及 Downs 和 Lyons，1990）。例如，在宾夕法尼亚的一项研究中（Stewart，1980），研究者在刑事审判开始前对74位男性被告的外貌进行了评分。很久之后，研究者查阅了这些案件的判决记录，发现长相英俊的被告判得明显更轻。事实上，外表吸引人的被告比不吸引人的被告逃避监禁的可能性高出一倍。在另一项模拟过失审判中，若被告比受害人更好看，平均赔偿金额为5,623美元；而当受害人更吸引人时，平均赔偿金额达到了10,051美元。更重要的是，男性和女性陪审员都表现出了这种基于外貌的偏见（Kulka 和 Kessler，1978）。
>
> 其他实验也显示，外表吸引人的人在需要帮助时更容易获得帮助（Benson、Karabenic 和 Lerner，1976），也更具说服力，更容易改变听众的意见（Chaiken，1979）……

将吸引力与智力、诚实或善良等特质联系在一起，是一种明显的偏见——尤其当你只是基于固定文本来判断这些品质时——因为从逻辑上讲，我们并不期望诚实和外貌吸引力之间存在正当的关联。另一方面，我被认为聪明，是否有一部分是因为我显得诚实？我被认为诚实，是不是部分因为显得聪明？寻求真理与陈述真理，两者之间并不如“外表好看”和“看起来聪明”那样截然分离……

但关于外貌吸引力的光环效应研究应该让我们警惕：也许善良或聪明同样存在光环效应。假设你认识一个人，不仅显得非常聪明，还显得诚实、无私、善良、平和。你应当怀疑：你对某些特质的感知，可能正在影响你对其他特质的判断。也许此人确实聪明、诚实、无私，但未必真的那么善良或平和。当你发现你认识的人似乎被清晰地划分为“天使”或“魔鬼”时，你应该对自己的判断多一份怀疑。

而且——我知道你觉得自己不用这样做，但你也许应该——对那些更有魅力的政治候选人，多一点怀疑。

## The Halo Effect

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

The affect heuristic is how an overall feeling of goodness or badness contributes to many other judgments, whether it’s logical or not, whether you’re aware of it or not. Subjects told about the benefits of nuclear power are likely to rate it as having fewer risks; stock analysts rating unfamiliar stocks judge them as generally good or generally bad—low risk and high returns, or high risk and low returns—in defiance of ordinary economic theory, which says that risk and return should correlate positively.

The halo effect is the manifestation of the affect heuristic in social psychology. Robert Cialdini summarizes:<sup>1</sup>

> Research has shown that we automatically assign to good-looking individuals such favorable traits as talent, kindness, honesty, and intelligence (for a review of this evidence, see Eagly, Ashmore, Makhijani, and Longo, 1991). Furthermore, we make these judgments without being aware that physical attractiveness plays a role in the process. Some consequences of this unconscious assumption that “good-looking equals good” scare me. For example, a study of the 1974 Canadian federal elections found that attractive candidates received more than two and a half times as many votes as unattractive candidates (Efran and Patterson, 1976). Despite such evidence of favoritism toward handsome politicians, follow-up research demonstrated that voters did not realize their bias. In fact, 73 percent of Canadian voters surveyed denied in the strongest possible terms that their votes had been influenced by physical appearance; only 14 percent even allowed for the possibility of such influence (Efran and Patterson, 1976). Voters can deny the impact of attractiveness on electability all they want, but evidence has continued to confirm its troubling presence (Budesheim and DePaola, 1994).
> 
> A similar effect has been found in hiring situations. In one study, good grooming of applicants in a simulated employment interview accounted for more favorable hiring decisions than did job qualifications—this, even though the interviewers claimed that appearance played a small role in their choices (Mack and Rainey, 1990). The advantage given to attractive workers extends past hiring day to payday. Economists examining US and Canadian samples have found that attractive individuals get paid an average of 12–14 percent more than their unattractive coworkers (Hamermesh and Biddle, 1994).
> 
> Equally unsettling research indicates that our judicial process is similarly susceptible to the influences of body dimensions and bone structure. It now appears that good-looking people are likely to receive highly favorable treatment in the legal system (see Castellow, Wuensch, and Moore, 1991; and Downs and Lyons, 1990, for reviews). For example, in a Pennsylvania study (Stewart, 1980), researchers rated the physical attractiveness of 74 separate male defendants at the start of their criminal trials. When, much later, the researchers checked court records for the results of these cases, they found that the handsome men had received significantly lighter sentences. In fact, attractive defendants were twice as likely to avoid jail as unattractive defendants. In another study—this one on the damages awarded in a staged negligence trial—a defendant who was better looking than his victim was assessed an average amount of $5,623; but when the victim was the more attractive of the two, the average compensation was $10,051. What’s more, both male and female jurors exhibited the attractiveness-based favoritism (Kulka and Kessler, 1978).
> 
> Other experiments have demonstrated that attractive people are more likely to obtain help when in need (Benson, Karabenic, and Lerner, 1976) and are more persuasive in changing the opinions of an audience (Chaiken, 1979) . . .

The influence of attractiveness on ratings of intelligence, honesty, or kindness is a clear example of bias—especially when you judge these other qualities based on fixed text—because we wouldn’t expect judgments of honesty and attractiveness to conflate for any legitimate reason. On the other hand, how much of my perceived intelligence is due to my honesty? How much of my perceived honesty is due to my intelligence? Finding the truth, and saying the truth, are not as widely separated in nature as looking pretty and looking smart . . .

But these studies on the halo effect of attractiveness should make us suspicious that there may be a similar halo effect for kindness, or intelligence. Let’s say that you know someone who not only seems very intelligent, but also honest, altruistic, kindly, and serene. You should be suspicious that some of these perceived characteristics are influencing your perception of the others. Maybe the person is genuinely intelligent, honest, and altruistic, but not all that kindly or serene. You should be suspicious if the people you know seem to separate too cleanly into devils and angels.

And—I know you don’t think you have to do it, but maybe you should—be just a little more skeptical of the more attractive political candidates.
