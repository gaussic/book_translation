## 当无人敢于呼吁克制

一天早晨，我起床后打开电脑，Netscape 邮件客户端自动下载了当天的新闻页面。那天的新闻是，两架被劫持的飞机撞上了世贸中心。

我当时依次冒出的三个念头是：

　　看来我真的生活在“未来”了。

　　谢天谢地，不是核武器。

　　然后是

　　对此事的过度反应会比事件本身严重十倍。

事实证明，“严重十倍”远远低估了后果。连我都没想到事情会变得这么糟。这就是悲观主义的难处：你很难把预期压得足够低，以至于你感到惊喜的次数和程度能和失望持平。

尽管如此，我立刻意识到，所有人都会说这件事多么可怕、多么糟糕；而没有人敢于发出克制、主张适度回应的声音。最初，9/11当天，人们以为有六千人遇难。任何政客如果敢说“六千人只相当于美国每年车祸死亡人数的八分之一”，都会在当天被要求辞职。

没错，9/11不是好日子。但如果所有人都在强调伤痛，没人敢于呼吁克制，那么无论什么才是“恰当”的反应，最终的反应都会远远超过那个水平。

这就是“幸福死亡螺旋”的黑暗镜像——仇恨螺旋。任何攻击“敌人”的人都是爱国者；而任何试图质疑哪怕一句关于“敌人”的负面说法的人，都是叛徒。但正如绝大多数复杂陈述都是假的一样，你能说出的关于任何人的绝大多数负面言论——哪怕是世界上最坏的人——也都是假的。

我觉得最典型的例子就是“自杀式劫机者是懦夫”。能不能有点常识？自愿驾驶飞机撞向大楼，是需要一定勇气的。在他们所有的罪行中，懦弱绝对不在其中。但我猜，只要是针对恐怖分子的坏话，无论多荒谬，大家都会觉得是真的。如果我指控基地组织暗杀了肯尼迪，是不是还能再多得点“政治正确分”？或者说他们是斯大林主义者？真的，懦夫？

没错，9/11劫机者不是懦夫，这一点很重要。不仅仅是为了理解敌人的真实心理。仇恨螺旋造成的伤害实在太大了。世界上任何一个群体，无论是犹太人还是希特勒，只要对他们的负面言论压倒了真实言论，都是极其危险的。

当防御力量拥有数千架飞机和几十万全副武装的士兵时，我们应该意识到，这样的“免疫系统”本身造成的破坏，可能比十九个人和四架非军用飞机还要大。美国花费了数十亿美元和数千士兵的生命，自己把脚打得比任何恐怖组织做梦都想不到的还狠。

如果美国完全无视9/11袭击——只是耸耸肩，重建大楼——结果都比历史上的真实进程要好。但这在政治上根本不可能。即使有人私下猜到“免疫反应”会比“疾病”本身更糟，美国政客也没有任何保住仕途的选择，只能直奔基地组织设下的陷阱。谁主张更强烈的反应，谁就是爱国者。谁质疑爱国言论，谁就是叛徒。

最初，对9/11的反应比我预想的还要理智。我看到有位国会议员（忘了是谁）在镜头前说：“我们忘了，政府的首要职责不是经济，也不是医疗，而是保卫国家免受攻击。”这让我很吃惊，居然有政客能说出不是“掌声灯”的话。情感冲击一定非常大，才让国会议员说出这样……真实的话。

但仅仅两天后，真正的震惊感就消退了，形象管理重新完全主导了政治话语。接着，升级的螺旋彻底接管了一切。一旦“克制”变成禁忌，无论讨论最初从哪里开始，愤怒和愚蠢的程度只会随着时间不断上升。

## When None Dare Urge Restraint

One morning, I got out of bed, turned on my computer, and my Netscape email client automatically downloaded that day’s news pane. On that particular day, the news was that two hijacked planes had been flown into the World Trade Center.

These were my first three thoughts, in order:

	I guess I really am living in the Future.

	Thank goodness it wasn’t nuclear.

	and then

	The overreaction to this will be ten times worse than the original event.

A mere factor of “ten times worse” turned out to be a vast understatement. Even I didn’t guess how badly things would go. That’s the challenge of pessimism; it’s really hard to aim low enough that you’re pleasantly surprised around as often and as much as you’re unpleasantly surprised.

Nonetheless, I did realize immediately that everyone everywhere would be saying how awful, how terrible this event was; and that no one would dare to be the voice of restraint, of proportionate response. Initially, on 9/11, it was thought that six thousand people had died. Any politician who had said, “6,000 deaths is 1/8 the annual US casualties from automobile accidents,” would have been asked to resign the same hour.

No, 9/11 wasn’t a good day. But if everyone gets brownie points for emphasizing how much it hurts, and no one dares urge restraint in how hard to hit back, then the reaction will be greater than the appropriate level, whatever the appropriate level may be.

This is the even darker mirror of the happy death spiral—the spiral of hate. Anyone who attacks the Enemy is a patriot; and whoever tries to dissect even a single negative claim about the Enemy is a traitor. But just as the vast majority of all complex statements are untrue, the vast majority of negative things you can say about anyone, even the worst person in the world, are untrue.

I think the best illustration was “the suicide hijackers were cowards.” Some common sense, please? It takes a little courage to voluntarily fly your plane into a building. Of all their sins, cowardice was not on the list. But I guess anything bad you say about a terrorist, no matter how silly, must be true. Would I get even more brownie points if I accused al-Qaeda of having assassinated John F. Kennedy? Maybe if I accused them of being Stalinists? Really, cowardice?

Yes, it matters that the 9/11 hijackers weren’t cowards. Not just for understanding the enemy’s realistic psychology. There is simply too much damage done by spirals of hate. It is just too dangerous for there to be any target in the world, whether it be the Jews or Adolf Hitler, about whom saying negative things trumps saying accurate things.

When the defense force contains thousands of aircraft and hundreds of thousands of heavily armed soldiers, one ought to consider that the immune system itself is capable of wreaking more damage than nineteen guys and four nonmilitary airplanes. The US spent billions of dollars and thousands of soldiers’ lives shooting off its own foot more effectively than any terrorist group could dream.

If the USA had completely ignored the 9/11 attack—just shrugged and rebuilt the building—it would have been better than the real course of history. But that wasn’t a political option. Even if anyone privately guessed that the immune response would be more damaging than the disease, American politicians had no career-preserving choice but to walk straight into al-Qaeda’s trap. Whoever argues for a greater response is a patriot. Whoever dissects a patriotic claim is a traitor.

Initially, there were smarter responses to 9/11 than I had guessed. I saw a Congressperson—I forget who—say in front of the cameras, “We have forgotten that the first purpose of government is not the economy, it is not health care, it is defending the country from attack.” That widened my eyes, that a politician could say something that wasn’t an applause light. The emotional shock must have been very great for a Congressperson to say something that . . . real.

But within two days, the genuine shock faded, and concern-for-image regained total control of the political discourse. Then the spiral of escalation took over completely. Once restraint becomes unspeakable, no matter where the discourse starts out, the level of fury and folly can only rise with time.
