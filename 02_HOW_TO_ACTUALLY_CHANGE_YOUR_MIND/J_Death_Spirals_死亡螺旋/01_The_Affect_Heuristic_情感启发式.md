## 情感启发法（The Affect Heuristic）

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

所谓**情感启发法**，是指我们对“好/坏”的主观印象，作为一种启发式方法——一种快速、感知式判断的来源。愉快与不愉快的感受在人类推理中起着核心作用，而情感启发法则带来了种种有趣的偏差——其中有些是我最喜欢的。

我们先从一个相对不那么疯狂的偏差讲起。你即将搬到一个新城市，需要运送一座古董落地钟。在第一种情况中，这座落地钟是你五岁生日时祖父母送的礼物。在第二种情况中，这座钟来自一位远房亲戚，你对它没有特别的感情。你愿意为一份如果钟在运输中丢失就赔付100美元的保险支付多少钱？根据 Hsee 和 Kunreuther 的研究，受试者在第一种情况下表示愿意支付的金额是第二种情况下的两倍还多。<sup>1</sup>

这听起来也许很合理——为什么不多花钱保护更有价值的东西？——但请注意，这份保险并不能保护这座钟，只是在钟丢失时赔付，而不论是哪一座钟，赔付金额都是一样的。（而且实验中也明确说明了保险来自外部公司，因此搬运工没有获得额外动机。）

好吧，这还不算太疯狂。你或许还能辩解说，受试者投保的其实是情感结果，而非金钱结果——一种安慰的购买。

那我们再来看这个例子：Yamagishi 的研究显示，当一种疾病被描述为“每一万人中有1,286人死亡”时，受试者认为它比描述为“致死率为24.14%”更危险。<sup>2</sup> 显然，“一千多具尸体”的心理画面远比“一个人有可能活下来”的表达更令人恐惧。

但等一下，还有更严重的情况。

假设一个机场需要决定是否购买某项新设备，而批评者则认为这些钱应该用于机场安全的其他方面。Slovic 等人向两个受试者组呈现了支持与反对购买的论点，评分范围是0（完全不支持）到20（非常支持）。<sup>3</sup> 一组看到该措施被描述为“能拯救150人”；另一组则看到“能拯救150人中的98%”。研究动机是假设“拯救150人”听起来模糊——那算多吗？算少吗？——而“拯救98%的人”则明显是件好事，因为98%接近百分比刻度的上限。结果显示，前者的平均支持度是10.4，而后者是13.6。

再来看看 Denes-Raj 和 Epstein 的研究：受试者有机会从碗中随机抽取红色糖豆，每抽到一个红豆即可赢得1美元。他们往往更愿意从红豆数量更多但比例更小的碗中抽取。<sup>4</sup> 例如，他们更偏好“100颗中有7颗红豆”而不是“10颗中有1颗红豆”。

根据 Denes-Raj 和 Epstein 的说法，这些受试者事后表示，尽管他们知道概率对自己不利，但他们“感觉”红豆多时机会更大。亲爱的“统计高手”读者，这听起来或许令你发笑，但如果你更深入地思考，会发现这其实完全说得通。7% 的概率比 10% 低，的确是坏消息，但红豆数量的增加“补偿”了这一点。概率较差，没错，但你**看起来**更有可能赢。你应该冥想这个想法，直到彻底开悟，明白这个世界上大多数人是如何理解概率的。

正如我在《正义的天平，理性的笔记本》中所讨论的，Finucane 等人发现，对于核反应堆、天然气和食品防腐剂等议题，当受试者看到高收益的信息时，他们会认为相关风险较低；当看到高风险信息时，则认为其收益较低。<sup>5</sup> 人们会将对某事的某个“好/坏”方面的判断，整合为一种整体上的好感或恶感。

Finucane 等人还发现，时间压力会大大增强这种“风险与收益感知之间的反向关系”。这一结果与更普遍的发现一致：时间压力、信息匮乏或分心，都会使人更依赖直觉启发法，而非分析式思考。

Ganzach 在金融领域也发现了相同的效应。<sup>6</sup> 按照传统经济学理论，回报与风险应呈正相关——换句话说，人们为安全投资支付溢价，从而拉低回报；股票比债券回报更高，但风险也更大。在判断熟悉的股票时，分析师对风险与回报的判断确实是正相关的，符合常规预期。但在判断不熟悉的股票时，分析师倾向于整体判断股票是“好”还是“坏”——要么低风险高回报，要么高风险低回报。

## The Affect Heuristic

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

The affect heuristic is when subjective impressions of goodness/badness act as a heuristic—a source of fast, perceptual judgments. Pleasant and unpleasant feelings are central to human reasoning, and the affect heuristic comes with lovely biases—some of my favorites.

Let’s start with one of the relatively less crazy biases. You’re about to move to a new city, and you have to ship an antique grandfather clock. In the first case, the grandfather clock was a gift from your grandparents on your fifth birthday. In the second case, the clock was a gift from a remote relative and you have no special feelings for it. How much would you pay for an insurance policy that paid out \$100 if the clock were lost in shipping? According to Hsee and Kunreuther, subjects stated willingness to pay more than twice as much in the first condition.<sup>1</sup> This may sound rational—why not pay more to protect the more valuable object?—until you realize that the insurance doesn’t protect the clock, it just pays if the clock is lost, and pays exactly the same amount for either clock. (And yes, it was stated that the insurance was with an outside company, so it gives no special motive to the movers.)

All right, but that doesn’t sound too insane. Maybe you could get away with claiming the subjects were insuring affective outcomes, not financial outcomes—purchase of consolation.

Then how about this? Yamagishi showed that subjects judged a disease as more dangerous when it was described as killing 1,286 people out of every 10,000, versus a disease that was 24.14% likely to be fatal.<sup>2</sup> Apparently the mental image of a thousand dead bodies is much more alarming, compared to a single person who’s more likely to survive than not.

But wait, it gets worse.

Suppose an airport must decide whether to spend money to purchase some new equipment, while critics argue that the money should be spent on other aspects of airport safety. Slovic et al. presented two groups of subjects with the arguments for and against purchasing the equipment, with a response scale ranging from 0 (would not support at all) to 20 (very strong support).<sup>3</sup> One group saw the measure described as saving 150 lives. The other group saw the measure described as saving 98% of 150 lives. The hypothesis motivating the experiment was that saving 150 lives sounds vaguely good—is that a lot? a little?—while saving 98% of something is clearly very good because 98% is so close to the upper bound of the percentage scale. Lo and behold, saving 150 lives had mean support of 10.4, while saving 98% of 150 lives had mean support of 13.6.

Or consider the report of Denes-Raj and Epstein: subjects who were offered an opportunity to win \$1 each time they randomly drew a red jelly bean from a bowl often preferred to draw from a bowl with more red beans and a smaller proportion of red beans.<sup>4</sup> E.g., 7 in 100 was preferred to 1 in 10.

According to Denes-Raj and Epstein, these subjects reported afterward that even though they knew the probabilities were against them, they felt they had a better chance when there were more red beans. This may sound crazy to you, oh Statistically Sophisticated Reader, but if you think more carefully you’ll realize that it makes perfect sense. A 7% probability versus 10% probability may be bad news, but it’s more than made up for by the increased number of red beans. It’s a worse probability, yes, but you’re still more likely to win, you see. You should meditate upon this thought until you attain enlightenment as to how the rest of the planet thinks about probability.

As I discussed in “The Scales of Justice, the Notebook of Rationality,” Finucane et al. found that for nuclear reactors, natural gas, and food preservatives, presenting information about high benefits made people perceive lower risks; presenting information about higher risks made people perceive lower benefits; and so on across the quadrants.<sup>5</sup> People conflate their judgments about particular good/bad aspects of something into an overall good or bad feeling about that thing.

Finucane et al. also found that time pressure greatly increased the inverse relationship between perceived risk and perceived benefit, consistent with the general finding that time pressure, poor information, or distraction all increase the dominance of perceptual heuristics over analytic deliberation.

Ganzach found the same effect in the realm of finance.<sup>6</sup> According to ordinary economic theory, return and risk should correlate positively—or to put it another way, people pay a premium price for safe investments, which lowers the return; stocks deliver higher returns than bonds, but have correspondingly greater risk. When judging familiar stocks, analysts’ judgments of risks and returns were positively correlated, as conventionally predicted. But when judging unfamiliar stocks, analysts tended to judge the stocks as if they were generally good or generally bad—low risk and high returns, or high risk and low returns.

For further reading I recommend Slovic’s fine summary article, “Rational Actors or Rational Fools: Implications of the Affect Heuristic for Behavioral Economics.”
