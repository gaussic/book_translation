## 无限量表、巨额陪审团裁决与未来主义

**作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky**

“心理物理学”（**psychophysics**）这个词虽然听起来不太靠谱，但其实是一个严肃的学科，用来研究物理效应与感官效应之间的关系。比如说：你往空气中释放声能——制造噪音——那对人来说这听起来有多响？你需要再增加多少声能，声音才会让人感觉响了一倍？答案并不是“多一倍”，而是“大概多八倍”。

声能和光子是可以直接测量的。你想知道一个声音有多响，一个光源有多亮，通常需要问听众或观众。这可以用一个有界量表来表示，比如从“非常安静”到“非常响”，或从“非常暗”到“非常亮”。你也可以使用**无限量表（unbounded scale）**，从“完全听不见”或“完全看不见”开始，然后无限上升。在使用无限量表时，通常会向观察者提供一个固定的**基准刺激（modulus）**，比如说一个声音被设定为响度10。那么观察者如果听到一个响两倍的声音，就可以标记为20。

这是一种相当可靠的测量方式。但如果你给受试者一个无限量表，却**不给他们基准值**怎么办？也就是说，从0到无限大，但没有任何参考点？那他们当然会自己“造”一个基准出来。不同受试者给出的评分之间，**比例关系**还是会高度一致。比如，受试者A说声音X的响度是10，声音Y是15；那么如果受试者B说声音X是100，那可以合理推测他会把声音Y评为150左右。但如果你不知道受试者C用的基准是什么——也就是他们的**比例因子（scaling factor）**——那你就完全没法预测他会给声音X打多少分。可能是1，也可能是1000。

所以，当一个受试者在没有基准值的无限量表上对**单一刺激**评分时，几乎所有的差异都来自于他们任意选择的基准，而不是刺激本身。

你可能会想：“嗯，这听起来很像陪审团在裁定惩罚性赔偿金额时的情形。难怪差异那么大！”这是个有趣的类比，但要如何通过实验证明呢？

Kahneman等人找来了867位符合陪审团资格的受试者，向他们展示一些法律案件的描述（比如一个小孩衣服着火的案例），然后要求他们：

1. 在一个**有界量表**上评定被告行为的“离谱程度”；
2. 在另一个**有界量表**上评定被告应受的惩罚程度；
3. 或者直接给出一个**惩罚性赔偿金额**（美元）。<sup>1</sup>

结果呢？果然不出所料：不同受试者在“离谱程度”和“惩罚程度”上的评分非常一致；但在惩罚性赔偿金额上，那真是**天差地别**。然而，如果你只看他们对于不同案例的赔偿金额排序（从最少赔偿到最多赔偿的顺序），那排序之间倒是相当一致。

如果你问：“不同受试者之间对某一案件在‘惩罚’量表上的差异，有多少是由案件本身解释的？”——即案例对评分的解释力——那么，即便是**原始得分**，解释力也有**0.49**。如果你只看赔偿金额的**排序**，解释力是**0.51**。但如果你看赔偿金额的**实际美元数**，解释力只有**0.06**！

也就是说：如果你知道了案件内容——比如那个衣服着火的小孩——你可以大致猜到受试者会打出什么样的“惩罚”分数，甚至可以猜出这个案件相对于其他案件的赔偿排序，但**具体金额是多少你根本无法预测**。

就算从12位随机受试者的评分中取**中位数**，也没太大帮助。

因此，**惩罚性赔偿金额**并不是某种经济价值的衡量，而更像是一种**态度表达**——在**没有标准基准**的无限量表上，对愤怒程度的一种“心理物理学式测量”。

我注意到，很多关于未来的预测也是类似的态度表达。比如那句老生常谈的问题：“我们多久之后会拥有人类水平的人工智能？”——对此的回答五花八门。在一次印象深刻的对话中，一位主流AI研究者对我说：“五百年。”（！！）

关于为什么预测AI到来时间这么不靠谱，其实可以展开长篇讨论。但我们可以肯定的是，这位说“五百年”的人，并不是“看到”了未来；他显然也不是用摩尔定律之类的套路算出来的。那么，“500”这个数字到底意味着什么？

我猜，他的回答就好像我问的是：“在一个以0表示‘一点也不难’的量表上，AI问题在你看来有多难？”如果这是个有界量表，那所有理智的受访者都会在最右侧标上“非常困难”。当你不知道怎么做某件事时，一切看起来都非常困难。但现在的问题是：这是一条**无限量表**，**没有标准基准值**。所以人们就自己拍一个数字来代表“非常难”，这个数字可能是50、100，甚至500。然后他们再把“年”加在后面，这就变成了他们的未来预测。

“AI问题有多难？”并不是唯一可替换的问题。有些人给出的回答看起来更像是他们在回应“你对AI的态度有多正面？”——只不过在他们的量表上，数字越小表示态度越正面——然后他们也把“年”加在了后面。但如果这些“时间预测”真代表了什么**其他内容**而不是一种**无基准的无限量表上的态度表达**，那我就完全搞不清楚它们是什么意思了。

## Unbounded Scales, Huge Jury Awards, and Futurism

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

“Psychophysics,” despite the name, is the respectable field that links physical effects to sensory effects. If you dump acoustic energy into air—make noise—then how loud does that sound to a person, as a function of acoustic energy? How much more acoustic energy do you have to pump into the air, before the noise sounds twice as loud to a human listener? It’s not twice as much; more like eight times as much.

Acoustic energy and photons are straightforward to measure. When you want to find out how loud an acoustic stimulus sounds, how bright a light source appears, you usually ask the listener or watcher. This can be done using a bounded scale from “very quiet” to “very loud,” or “very dim” to “very bright.” You can also use an unbounded scale, whose zero is “not audible at all” or “not visible at all,” but which increases from there without limit. When you use an unbounded scale, the observer is typically presented with a constant stimulus, the modulus, which is given a fixed rating. For example, a sound that is assigned a loudness of 10. Then the observer can indicate a sound twice as loud as the modulus by writing 20.

And this has proven to be a fairly reliable technique. But what happens if you give subjects an unbounded scale, but no modulus? Zero to infinity, with no reference point for a fixed value? Then they make up their own modulus, of course. The ratios between stimuli will continue to correlate reliably between subjects. Subject A says that sound X has a loudness of 10 and sound Y has a loudness of 15. If subject B says that sound X has a loudness of 100, then it’s a good guess that subject B will assign loudness in the vicinity of 150 to sound Y. But if you don’t know what subject C is using as their modulus—their scaling factor—then there’s no way to guess what subject C will say for sound X. It could be 1. It could be 1,000.

For a subject rating a single sound, on an unbounded scale, without a fixed standard of comparison, nearly all the variance is due to the arbitrary choice of modulus, rather than the sound itself.

“Hm,” you think to yourself, “this sounds an awful lot like juries deliberating on punitive damages. No wonder there’s so much variance!” An interesting analogy, but how would you go about demonstrating it experimentally?

Kahneman et al. presented 867 jury-eligible subjects with descriptions of legal cases (e.g., a child whose clothes caught on fire) and asked them to either

1. Rate the outrageousness of the defendant’s actions, on a bounded scale, 
2. Rate the degree to which the defendant should be punished, on a bounded scale, or  
3. Assign a dollar value to punitive damages.<sup>1</sup>

And, lo and behold, while subjects correlated very well with each other in their outrage ratings and their punishment ratings, their punitive damages were all over the map. Yet subjects’ rank-ordering of the punitive damages—their ordering from lowest award to highest award—correlated well across subjects.

If you asked how much of the variance in the “punishment” scale could be explained by the specific scenario—the particular legal case, as presented to multiple subjects—then the answer, even for the raw scores, was 0.49. For the rank orders of the dollar responses, the amount of variance predicted was 0.51. For the raw dollar amounts, the variance explained was 0.06!

Which is to say: if you knew the scenario presented—the aforementioned child whose clothes caught on fire—you could take a good guess at the punishment rating, and a good guess at the rank-ordering of the dollar award relative to other cases, but the dollar award itself would be completely unpredictable.

Taking the median of twelve randomly selected responses didn’t help much either.

So a jury award for punitive damages isn’t so much an economic valuation as an attitude expression—a psychophysical measure of outrage, expressed on an unbounded scale with no standard modulus.

I observe that many futuristic predictions are, likewise, best considered as attitude expressions. Take the question, “How long will it be until we have human-level AI?” The responses I’ve seen to this are all over the map. On one memorable occasion, a mainstream AI guy said to me, “Five hundred years.” (!!)

Now the reason why time-to-AI is just not very predictable, is a long discussion in its own right. But it’s not as if the guy who said “Five hundred years” was looking into the future to find out. And he can’t have gotten the number using the standard bogus method with Moore’s Law. So what did the number 500 mean?

As far as I can guess, it’s as if I’d asked, “On a scale where zero is ‘not difficult at all,’ how difficult does the AI problem feel to you?” If this were a bounded scale, every sane respondent would mark “extremely hard” at the right-hand end. Everything feels extremely hard when you don’t know how to do it. But instead there’s an unbounded scale with no standard modulus. So people just make up a number to represent “extremely difficult,” which may come out as 50, 100, or even 500. Then they tack “years” on the end, and that’s their futuristic prediction.

“How hard does the AI problem feel?” isn’t the only substitutable question. Others respond as if I’d asked “How positive do you feel about AI?”—except lower numbers mean more positive feelings—and then they also tack “years” on the end. But if these “time estimates” represent anything other than attitude expressions on an unbounded scale with no modulus, I have been unable to determine it.
