## 超级英雄偏见

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

设想有一个全副武装的反社会者——一个绑架了人质的恶徒——刚刚拒绝了所有谈判请求，并宣布要开始杀人。在现实生活中，当坏人手中握有人质时，好人通常不会踹门而入。但有时候——虽然极其罕见，但确实会发生——现实也会模仿好莱坞，出现真正的好人需要破门而入的时刻。

想象，在两个相距遥远的现实中，有两位英雄最先冲进房间，与恶徒对峙。

在一个现实中，这位英雄拥有掀翻汽车的力量，能从鼻孔中发射能量波，有X光听力，皮肤不仅能抵挡子弹，甚至能在接触的瞬间消灭子弹。恶徒藏身于一所小学，劫持了超过两百名儿童做人质；孩子们的父母正痛哭着等候在外面。

而在另一个现实中，这位英雄是一名纽约警察，而人质是三个被恶徒从街上拐走的妓女。

请你非常认真地思考这个问题：谁才是更伟大的英雄？谁更有可能拥有自己的漫画书？

“光环效应”（halo effect）指的是人们往往将所有积极特质联系在一起。外貌更有吸引力的角色，也更容易被评价为更有才华、更善良、更诚实、更聪明。

于是，那些看起来强大且刀枪不入的漫画人物——这两种都被认为是积极特质——也更容易被认为具有更多英勇无畏的英雄特质。然而：

> “如果你几乎是刀枪不入的，那装出一副英勇无畏的样子，能有多难？”
>
> ——亚当·沃伦，《赋能》第一卷

我记不清是在哪看到过以下这个观点，还是我自己推论出来的：名声，似乎会与一个人的其他性格特质叠加在一起。想想甘地。甘地是二十世纪最无私的人，还是仅仅是最著名的无私者？甘地面对的是持警棍的警察和持枪的士兵。但甘地是一位名人，他受到了他的名气的保护。那么，那些和他一起游行、同样面对警棍和枪支、却不会因为被打进医院或被枪杀而上国际头条的人呢？

当甘地成为报纸头条、成为名人、成为历史人物、成为非暴力抗争的象征时，他是如何看待自己冒的风险要比那些和他一起游行的人少得多这一点的？当那些无名的英雄走到他面前，眼里闪着光，告诉他他有多么了不起时，他是什么感受？甘地是否曾以这样的方式看待自己的世界？我不知道；我不是甘地。

这绝不是在批评甘地。非暴力抗争的目的不是炫耀自己的勇气。要炫耀勇气的话，可以跳进尼亚加拉瀑布里坐桶下水，那容易得多。甘地无法避免因为名气而获得部分但非完全的保护。而且甘地的行为确实需要勇气——虽然没有匿名抗议者那么多，但仍然需要相当大的勇气。

我想指出的偏见是，人们在认知上，会把甘地的“名气分数”加到他本应获得的“无私分数”上。当你想到非暴力，你会想到甘地——而不是某个在他领导的游行中，面对警棍和枪支被殴打、送进医院、从此一瘸一拐、而名字从未被人记住的无名抗议者。

类似地，哪一个更伟大——冒着生命危险去拯救两百名儿童，还是冒着生命危险去拯救三个成年人？

答案取决于你对“更伟大”的定义。如果你必须在拯救两百名儿童和三位成年人之间做出选择，那就选前者。“谁救了一条人命，就如同救了全世界”也许是一句感人至深的口号，但如果你必须在二者之间做出选择，它是一个糟糕的道德指导。所以，如果你问“更伟大”是指“更重要”或“更值得选择”的话，那么拯救两百人要比拯救三人更“伟大”。

但如果你问的是，从显露出的美德来看，哪个更伟大——那么，那些愿意冒生命危险去拯救仅仅三条生命的人，比那些只愿意为拯救两百人而冒险、却不会为三人冒险的人，表现出更大的勇气。

这并不意味着你可以故意选择去救三个成年人，而让那两百个孩子去死，只因为你想表现出更多的美德。一个为了看起来有美德而冒险的人，其实显露出的美德远远不如一个只是想去救人的人。如果一个人选择救三个人而不是两百人，仅仅因为他认为这样能显示出更大的“高尚”，那么他对自身“伟大”的自我迷恋，几乎等同于在道德层面上犯下了过失杀人的罪行。

这是那种“无为而为”的场景：你无法通过“试图展现美德”来展现美德。在一个可以用毫无个人代价的安全方式拯救世界，和一个需要冒生命危险、承受巨大痛苦的方式之间，你不能靠选择后者成为英雄。想看起来像英雄，并没有任何英雄本质可言。这只是一种目的迷失。

真正有美德、真正想要拯救他人的人，会不断寻找更高效、更节省成本的救援方式，这也意味着他们展现出的美德会更少。这也许让人困惑，但并不矛盾。

但我们并不能总是选择自己刀枪不入。当我们已经竭尽所能降低风险、扩大影响力后，所剩下的英勇行为，才是真正的英勇。

那位在没有超能力、没有X光视觉、没有超级力量、不会飞、最重要的是无法抵御子弹的情况下，仍愿意将生命置于危险之中的警察，比起超人——那个“仅仅是超级英雄”的角色——展现出了更伟大的美德。

## Superhero Bias

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Suppose there’s a heavily armed sociopath, a kidnapper with hostages, who has just rejected all requests for negotiation and announced his intent to start killing. In real life, the good guys don’t usually kick down the door when the bad guy has hostages. But sometimes—very rarely, but sometimes—life imitates Hollywood to the extent of genuine good guys needing to smash through a door.

Imagine, in two widely separated realities, two heroes who charge into the room, first to confront the villain.

In one reality, the hero is strong enough to throw cars, can fire power blasts out of his nostrils, has X-ray hearing, and his skin doesn’t just deflect bullets but annihilates them on contact. The villain has ensconced himself in an elementary school and taken over two hundred children hostage; their parents are waiting outside, weeping.

In another reality, the hero is a New York police officer, and the hostages are three prostitutes the villain collected off the street.

Consider this question very carefully: Who is the greater hero? And who is more likely to get their own comic book?

The halo effect is that perceptions of all positive traits are correlated. Profiles rated higher on scales of attractiveness are also rated higher on scales of talent, kindness, honesty, and intelligence.

And so comic-book characters who seem strong and invulnerable, both positive traits, also seem to possess more of the heroic traits of courage and heroism. And yet:

> How tough can it be to act all brave and courageous when you’re pretty much invulnerable?
> 
> —Adam Warren, Empowered, Vol. 1

I can’t remember if I read the following point somewhere, or hypothesized it myself: Fame, in particular, seems to combine additively with all other personality characteristics. Consider Gandhi. Was Gandhi the most altruistic person of the twentieth century, or just the most famous altruist? Gandhi faced police with riot sticks and soldiers with guns. But Gandhi was a celebrity, and he was protected by his celebrity. What about the others in the march, the people who faced riot sticks and guns even though there wouldn’t be international headlines if they were put in the hospital or gunned down?

What did Gandhi think of getting the headlines, the celebrity, the fame, the place in history, becoming the archetype for non-violent resistance, when he took less risk than any of the people marching with him? How did he feel when one of those anonymous heroes came up to him, eyes shining, and told Gandhi how wonderful he was? Did Gandhi ever visualize his world in those terms? I don’t know; I’m not Gandhi.

This is not in any sense a criticism of Gandhi. The point of non-violent resistance is not to show off your courage. That can be done much more easily by going over Niagara Falls in a barrel. Gandhi couldn’t help being somewhat-but-not-entirely protected by his celebrity. And Gandhi’s actions did take courage—not as much courage as marching anonymously, but still a great deal of courage.

The bias I wish to point out is that Gandhi’s fame score seems to get perceptually added to his justly accumulated altruism score. When you think about nonviolence, you think of Gandhi—not an anonymous protestor in one of Gandhi’s marches who faced down riot clubs and guns, and got beaten, and had to be taken to the hospital, and walked with a limp for the rest of her life, and no one ever remembered her name.

Similarly, which is greater—to risk your life to save two hundred children, or to risk your life to save three adults?

The answer depends on what one means by greater. If you ever have to choose between saving two hundred children and saving three adults, then choose the former. “Whoever saves a single life, it is as if he had saved the whole world” may be a fine applause light, but it’s terrible moral advice if you’ve got to pick one or the other. So if you mean “greater” in the sense of “Which is more important?” or “Which is the preferred outcome?” or “Which should I choose if I have to do one or the other?” then it is greater to save two hundred than three.

But if you ask about greatness in the sense of revealed virtue, then someone who would risk their life to save only three lives reveals more courage than someone who would risk their life to save two hundred but not three.

This doesn’t mean that you can deliberately choose to risk your life to save three adults, and let the two hundred schoolchildren go hang, because you want to reveal more virtue. Someone who risks their life because they want to be virtuous has revealed far less virtue than someone who risks their life because they want to save others. Someone who chooses to save three lives rather than two hundred lives, because they think it reveals greater virtue, is so selfishly fascinated with their own “greatness” as to have committed the moral equivalent of manslaughter.

It’s one of those wu wei scenarios: You cannot reveal virtue by trying to reveal virtue. Given a choice between a safe method to save the world which involves no personal sacrifice or discomfort, and a method that risks your life and requires you to endure great privation, you cannot become a hero by deliberately choosing the second path. There is nothing heroic about wanting to look like a hero. It would be a lost purpose.

Truly virtuous people who are genuinely trying to save lives, rather than trying to reveal virtue, will constantly seek to save more lives with less effort, which means that less of their virtue will be revealed. It may be confusing, but it’s not contradictory.

But we cannot always choose to be invulnerable to bullets. After we’ve done our best to reduce risk and increase scope, any remaining heroism is well and truly revealed.

The police officer who puts their life on the line with no superpowers, no X-Ray vision, no super-strength, no ability to fly, and above all no invulnerability to bullets, reveals far greater virtue than Superman—who is a mere superhero.
