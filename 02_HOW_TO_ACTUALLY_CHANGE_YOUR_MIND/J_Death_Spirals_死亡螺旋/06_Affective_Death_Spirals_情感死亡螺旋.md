## 情感死亡螺旋（Affective Death Spirals）

**作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky**

人类推理中有**太多太多太多**的缺陷，都会导致我们**高估**自己钟爱的理论对事实的解释力。曾经的**燃素说**几乎可以解释任何现象——只要你不要求它事先做出预测。而你用自己偏爱的理论解释的现象越多，这个理论就**显得越正确**——难道不是被这么多观察所“证实”了吗？随着这个理论看起来越来越“真”，你就**越有可能质疑与之相冲突的证据**。而当你觉得它越“普适”，你就越倾向于用它来解释更多事情。

如果你认识某个相信**比利时秘密控制美国银行系统**的人，或者相信**他们可以用一种看不见的蓝色灵力来寻找停车位**的人——那很可能就是他们是这么开始的。

> （留意观察，你会发现很多现象“似乎验证了这个理论”……）

这种**轻信与确认之间的正反馈循环**确实令人畏惧，是科学和日常生活中大量错误的根源。

但相比起由一个**正向情感冲击**开始的“死亡螺旋”，那简直不算什么——**一个让你感觉非常好的想法。**

比如说，一个可以**拯救世界的新政治制度**。一个**伟大、强大、高尚又睿智的领袖**。一种**既能治胃痛又能治癌症的神奇药水**。

甚至，何不**三者兼得**？伟大的事业需要伟大的领袖。伟大的领袖应该能**酿出一两种神奇的灵药**。

所谓的**光环效应（halo effect）**，是指人们对某个正面特质（比如外貌或力量）的认知，会**增强对其他正面特质**（比如智慧或勇气）的看法。即使这种关联**完全没有道理，甚至荒唐可笑**。

一个正面特质能增强对其他正面特质的感知？这听起来就像是**一颗正在裂变的铀原子**发射出中子，引发其他铀原子的裂变。

**微弱的正向情感是次临界的**；它不会失控螺旋。比如，一个有魅力的人可能看起来更诚实，这又可能让他们看起来更有魅力——但从“中子乘积系数”来看，还是小于1的。打个比方吧。虽然“共鸣”会让事情一度混乱，但最终会消散。

而当**强烈的正向情感**附着在那个“伟大的东西”上时，这种“共鸣”就无所不在了。一个忠诚信仰共产主义的人，能在**麦当劳里卖的每一个汉堡里都看到马克思的智慧**；在每一次被拒的升职机会中看到\*\*“真正的工人天堂”里本该属于他的待遇\*\*；在每一场不合心意的选举中，在每一篇“方向错误”的新闻报道中，都能看出那个**伟大理念**的影子。每当他用这个理念去解释一个新事件，这个理念就“再次被确认”一次。感觉更好了——这是**正向强化**。而当一件事让我们感觉很好时，我们——不幸的是——就**更想相信它**。

当那个“伟大的东西”让你感到如此美好，以至于你**主动寻找新机会来感觉得更好**，天天用它来解释新事件时，这种正向情感的共鸣，就像一个**装满了放好老鼠夹和乒乓球的密闭房间**。

你可以叫它“快乐吸引子”、“过度正向反馈”、“赞美闭环”或“开心纸”。
我个人更喜欢的说法是：**情感死亡螺旋（affective death spiral）**。

## Affective Death Spirals

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Many, many, many are the flaws in human reasoning which lead us to overestimate how well our beloved theory explains the facts. The phlogiston theory of chemistry could explain just about anything, so long as it didn’t have to predict it in advance. And the more phenomena you use your favored theory to explain, the truer your favored theory seems—has it not been confirmed by these many observations? As the theory seems truer, you will be more likely to question evidence that conflicts with it. As the favored theory seems more general, you will seek to use it in more explanations.

If you know anyone who believes that Belgium secretly controls the US banking system, or that they can use an invisible blue spirit force to detect available parking spaces, that’s probably how they got started.

(Just keep an eye out, and you’ll observe much that seems to confirm this theory . . .)

This positive feedback cycle of credulity and confirmation is indeed fearsome, and responsible for much error, both in science and in everyday life.

But it’s nothing compared to the death spiral that begins with a charge of positive affect—a thought that feels really good.

A new political system that can save the world. A great leader, strong and noble and wise. An amazing tonic that can cure upset stomachs and cancer.

Heck, why not go for all three? A great cause needs a great leader. A great leader should be able to brew up a magical tonic or two.

The halo effect is that any perceived positive characteristic (such as attractiveness or strength) increases perception of any other positive characteristic (such as intelligence or courage). Even when it makes no sense, or less than no sense.

Positive characteristics enhance perception of every other positive characteristic? That sounds a lot like how a fissioning uranium atom sends out neutrons that fission other uranium atoms.

Weak positive affect is subcritical; it doesn’t spiral out of control. An attractive person seems more honest, which, perhaps, makes them seem more attractive; but the effective neutron multiplication factor is less than one. Metaphorically speaking. The resonance confuses things a little, but then dies out.

With intense positive affect attached to the Great Thingy, the resonance touches everywhere. A believing Communist sees the wisdom of Marx in every hamburger bought at McDonald’s; in every promotion they’re denied that would have gone to them in a true worker’s paradise; in every election that doesn’t go to their taste; in every newspaper article “slanted in the wrong direction.” Every time they use the Great Idea to interpret another event, the Great Idea is confirmed all the more. It feels better—positive reinforcement—and of course, when something feels good, that, alas, makes us want to believe it all the more.

When the Great Thingy feels good enough to make you seek out new opportunities to feel even better about the Great Thingy, applying it to interpret new events every day, the resonance of positive affect is like a chamber full of mousetraps loaded with ping-pong balls.

You could call it a “happy attractor,” “overly positive feedback,” a “praise locked loop,” or “funpaper.” Personally I prefer the term “affective death spiral.”
