## 比历史更陌生

假设我告诉你，我确切知道以下这些说法都是真的：

- 如果你把自己涂成一种介于蓝色和绿色之间的特定颜色，重力的作用会反转，你会向上掉。
- 未来，天空中将布满数十亿个漂浮的黑色球体。每个球体都比有史以来所有齐柏林飞艇加起来还要大。如果你给球体送钱，它会用蹦极绳从天上放下一个男妓。
- 你的孙辈会认为，把小偷关进监狱而不是打屁股，不仅愚蠢，而且邪恶。

你肯定会觉得我疯了，对吧？

那么假设现在是1901年，你必须在相信我刚才说的这些话，和相信下面这些话之间做选择：

- 物体之间相对运动的速度有一个绝对上限，正好是每小时670,616,629.2英里。如果你坐上一辆接近这个速度的火车，再从窗外开枪，长度的基本单位会发生变化，所以在你看来子弹会飞快地超过你，但其他人看到的却不一样。哦，对了，时间也会发生变化。
- 未来会有一个超级互联的全球网络，连接着数十亿台计算机，每台计算机的算力都超过1901年前所有计算器的总和。这个网络的主要用途之一，是通过把女同性恋色情视频伪装成数字来传输它们的动态图像。
- 你的孙辈会认为，说某人不能当美国总统仅仅因为她是黑人，不只是愚蠢，甚至是邪恶的。

灵感来自 Robin Hanson 的评论：“我想知道，是否可以用足够详细的方式描述一个虚构的另类现实故事，让我们的祖先无法分辨真假，从而让人们清楚地看到，真实的历史其实有多么令人惊讶。”<sup>1</sup>

## Stranger than History

Suppose I told you that I knew for a fact that the following statements were true:
- If you paint yourself a certain exact color between blue and green, it will reverse the force of gravity on you and cause you to fall upward.
- In the future, the sky will be filled by billions of floating black spheres. Each sphere will be larger than all the zeppelins that have ever existed put together. If you offer a sphere money, it will lower a male prostitute out of the sky on a bungee cord.
- Your grandchildren will think it is not just foolish, but evil, to put thieves in jail instead of spanking them.

You’d think I was crazy, right?

Now suppose it were the year 1901, and you had to choose between believing those statements I have just offered, and believing statements like the following:

- There is an absolute speed limit on how fast two objects can seem to be traveling relative to each other, which is exactly 670,616,629.2 miles per hour. If you hop on board a train going almost this fast and fire a gun out the window, the fundamental units of length change around, so it looks to you like the bullet is speeding ahead of you, but other people see something different. Oh, and time changes around too.
- In the future, there will be a superconnected global network of billions of adding machines, each one of which has more power than all pre-1901 adding machines put together. One of the primary uses of this network will be to transport moving pictures of lesbian sex by pretending they are made out of numbers.
- Your grandchildren will think it is not just foolish, but evil, to say that someone should not be President of the United States because she is black.

Based on a comment of Robin Hanson’s: “I wonder if one could describe in enough detail a fictional story of an alternative reality, a reality that our ancestors could not distinguish from the truth, in order to make it very clear how surprising the truth turned out to be.”<sup>1</sup>
