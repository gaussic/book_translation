## 回避信仰中真正脆弱的部分

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

几年前，我的曾祖母去世了，享年九十多岁。她的离世是一场漫长、缓慢而残酷的衰亡。我并不真正认识她这个人，但在遥远的童年记忆里，她曾为家人做饭；我记得她做的鱼饼（gefilte fish），记得她的面容，也记得她对我很温柔。她的葬礼上，我的外叔公（多年照顾她）发言。他哽咽着说，上帝一点一点地将他的母亲带走：先是记忆，然后是语言，最后是笑容；当上帝连她的笑容也夺走时，他知道她很快就要离开了，因为那意味着她几乎已经不复存在。

我听到这番话时感到困惑，因为这是对任何人来说都不可想象的可怕遭遇，而我不明白为什么叔公会将这归因于上帝。通常，一个犹太人不会去深想这种悲剧背后的逻辑含义——即上帝竟允许这种事发生。按照犹太教神学的说法，上帝不断维持宇宙的运行，并决定其中发生的每一件事；但通常，只有在喜事发生时才会将这个信仰应用到逻辑推理中。比如生了个女孩时会说“是上帝赐的！”，而流产、死胎或婴儿猝死时，则选择**不去想**“是上帝做的！”。这样一来，就可以建立一个对上帝仁慈性格的极其片面的认知。

因此，我很惊讶地听到叔公把他母亲缓慢的衰亡说成是上帝蓄意、精心策划的行为。这违反了我所理解的宗教自我欺骗的规则。

如果我当时意识到自己的困惑，我也许能做出一个成功且出人意料的预测。不久之后，叔公脱离了犹太教信仰。（据我所知，除了我自己，他是我大家庭中唯一一个这样做的人。）

现代正统犹太教不像我所听说的任何其他宗教，我也不知道该如何向没有被迫学习《米示拿》和《塔木德》的人描述它。它确实有“质疑”的传统，但这种“质疑”……你完全不会惊讶地听到一位拉比在每周的讲道中指出“创世七日”和“大爆炸后137亿年”的矛盾——因为他自以为想出了一个很巧妙的解释，涉及三处圣经典故、一则米大示和一篇没完全读懂的《科学美国人》文章。在正统犹太教中，你可以意识到矛盾和不一致，但只能为了**解释清楚**而意识到它们，而且谁的解释最复杂，谁就赢。

质疑是被允许的，但质疑只能是为了辩护。你只能攻击那些你知道自己能防守的目标。

在现代正统犹太教中，我没听过太多关于盲目信仰的赞美。你可以怀疑，但你不能真正地**成功地**怀疑。

我相信大多数受过教育的正统犹太人，在某个阶段都质疑过自己的信仰。但这种质疑可能是这样的：

> “怀疑论者说，《圣经》讲宇宙是七天创造的，不科学。可就算当年上帝想告诉西奈山下的以色列人科学真相，他们也听不懂啊，对吧？他们连‘十亿’这个词都没有吧？所以说七天的故事其实是个比喻——比如第一天上帝创造了光，那其实是在讲大爆炸……”

但这是攻击犹太教信仰的**最脆弱**点吗？读《圣经》再往后一点，你会看到上帝为了逼迫一个没有民意基础的法老释放奴隶，而选择屠杀整个埃及的头生男婴——尽管这些奴隶完全可以被瞬移出去。正统犹太人当然对这个情节非常熟悉，因为他们每年都要在会堂里读完整部《圣经》，而这个事件还搭配了一个重要的节日。“逾越节”（Pesach）这个名字，就来自“上帝越过了犹太人家门”，而屠杀了埃及所有的头生男婴。

现代正统犹太人大多是善良而文明的人，远比《旧约》的几位编纂者文明，甚至比古代的拉比们都更文明。在逾越节的仪式中，有一项是从酒杯中取十滴酒——每滴代表一个灾难（瘟疫），以表达对埃及人受苦的同情。（当然，你应该同情埃及人的苦难，但**不能同情到站起来说“这不对！这么做是错的！”**）这呈现出一种有趣的反差——拉比们比旧约的作者更有同理心，能够看出灾祸的残酷。但当时科学力量尚弱，因此拉比们可以反思经文中的黑暗面，而不会彻底动摇自己的信仰。

人们甚至不会去问这个事件是否让上帝的形象显得恶劣，因此也不需要急忙说出“上帝的旨意不可测！”、“我们不够聪明，不能质疑上帝的决定！”或“上帝杀婴儿是可以的！”这类话。这种问题被彻底**排除在思考范围之外**。

我怀疑，受过教育的宗教信徒之所以能继续保持信仰，是因为他们在质疑时，本能地会**只攻击那些最强的点**——那些他们知道自己能为之辩护的部分。而且，反复演练标准回应，还能让他们**感觉更坚定**。

比如，“科学不是说宇宙只是一些没有意义的原子乱撞吗？”这类问题就非常适合用来反复演练“宇宙的意义源于上帝”这样的答辩，让人觉得温暖而坚定。比起设想一个目不识丁的埃及母亲在儿子被屠杀后伏在摇篮边的哀号，这种思考方式舒适太多了。一个人在质疑犹太教信仰时，如果会**本能地想到后者**，那他才是真的在质疑，很可能不久就会放弃信仰。

我并不是只想批判正统犹太教。我相信关于“杀死头生男婴”这件事，也一定有人给出过各种回应，可能还不止一种。但我的重点是：在自发性的自我质疑中，人们**更倾向于攻击那些有安慰性答复的问题**，而不是去直面真正脆弱、令人痛苦的部分。同样的，人们也容易在找到第一个回应时就感到安心，而不是继续深入地批判这个回应。其实，比《回避信仰的真正脆弱点》更准确的标题也许是：

> **“我们不会自发地去思考信仰中最痛苦的脆弱之处。”**

信仰之所以能持续存在，更多是因为人们选择**不去想**自己宗教中最脆弱的部分。我不认为这是一种训练的结果，而是一种本能。人们不愿面对自己信仰中的真正脆弱点，就像他们不会去触摸烤箱上灼热的红色炉丝一样——因为那真的会很痛。

如果你想做得更好：当你怀疑自己最珍视的信念时，闭上眼睛，清空思绪，咬紧牙关，**刻意去想那些最痛的部分**。不要重复那些让你舒服的标准反驳。想一想那些比你聪明的反对者会如何反击你的第一层回应、第二层回应。每当你发现自己本能地回避了某个念头，把它拽出来放到意识最前端。狠狠击打自己的心窝，把刀插入内心，扭动刀刃让伤口撕裂。在痛苦面前，只重复这一段话：\[^1]

> 真相已经是事实。
>
> 直面它，并不会让它变得更糟。
>
> 逃避它，也不会让它消失。
>
> 正因为它是真实的，它就是你必须接触的东西。
>
> 虚假的东西，无法生活其中。
>
> 人们能够承受真相，
> 
> 因为他们已经在承受它了。

## Avoiding Your Belief’s Real Weak Points

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

A few years back, my great-grandmother died, in her nineties, after a long, slow, and cruel disintegration. I never knew her as a person, but in my distant childhood, she cooked for her family; I remember her gefilte fish, and her face, and that she was kind to me. At her funeral, my grand-uncle, who had taken care of her for years, spoke. He said, choking back tears, that God had called back his mother piece by piece: her memory, and her speech, and then finally her smile; and that when God finally took her smile, he knew it wouldn’t be long before she died, because it meant that she was almost entirely gone.

I heard this and was puzzled, because it was an unthinkably horrible thing to happen to anyone, and therefore I would not have expected my grand-uncle to attribute it to God. Usually, a Jew would somehow just-not-think-about the logical implication that God had permitted a tragedy. According to Jewish theology, God continually sustains the universe and chooses every event in it; but ordinarily, drawing logical implications from this belief is reserved for happier occasions. By saying “God did it!” only when you’ve been blessed with a baby girl, and just-not-thinking “God did it!” for miscarriages and stillbirths and crib deaths, you can build up quite a lopsided picture of your God’s benevolent personality.

Hence I was surprised to hear my grand-uncle attributing the slow disintegration of his mother to a deliberate, strategically planned act of God. It violated the rules of religious self-deception as I understood them.

If I had noticed my own confusion, I could have made a successful surprising prediction. Not long afterward, my grand-uncle left the Jewish religion. (The only member of my extended family besides myself to do so, as far as I know.)

Modern Orthodox Judaism is like no other religion I have ever heard of, and I don’t know how to describe it to anyone who hasn’t been forced to study Mishna and Gemara. There is a tradition of questioning, but the kind of questioning . . . It would not be at all surprising to hear a rabbi, in his weekly sermon, point out the conflict between the seven days of creation and the 13.7 billion years since the Big Bang—because he thought he had a really clever explanation for it, involving three other Biblical references, a Midrash, and a half-understood article in Scientific American. In Orthodox Judaism you’re allowed to notice inconsistencies and contradictions, but only for purposes of explaining them away, and whoever comes up with the most complicated explanation gets a prize.

There is a tradition of inquiry. But you only attack targets for purposes of defending them. You only attack targets you know you can defend.

In Modern Orthodox Judaism I have not heard much emphasis of the virtues of blind faith. You’re allowed to doubt. You’re just not allowed to successfully doubt.

I expect that the vast majority of educated Orthodox Jews have questioned their faith at some point in their lives. But the questioning probably went something like this: “According to the skeptics, the Torah says that the universe was created in seven days, which is not scientifically accurate. But would the original tribespeople of Israel, gathered at Mount Sinai, have been able to understand the scientific truth, even if it had been presented to them? Did they even have a word for ‘billion’? It’s easier to see the seven-days story as a metaphor—first God created light, which represents the Big Bang . . .”

Is this the weakest point at which to attack one’s own Judaism? Read a bit further on in the Torah, and you can find God killing the first-born male children of Egypt to convince an unelected Pharaoh to release slaves who logically could have been teleported out of the country. An Orthodox Jew is most certainly familiar with this episode, because they are supposed to read through the entire Torah in synagogue once per year, and this event has an associated major holiday. The name “Passover” (“Pesach”) comes from God passing over the Jewish households while killing every male firstborn in Egypt.

Modern Orthodox Jews are, by and large, kind and civilized people; far more civilized than the several editors of the Old Testament. Even the old rabbis were more civilized. There’s a ritual in the Seder where you take ten drops of wine from your cup, one drop for each of the Ten Plagues, to emphasize the suffering of the Egyptians. (Of course, you’re supposed to be sympathetic to the suffering of the Egyptians, but not so sympathetic that you stand up and say, “This is not right! It is wrong to do such a thing!”) It shows an interesting contrast—the rabbis were sufficiently kinder than the compilers of the Old Testament that they saw the harshness of the Plagues. But Science was weaker in these days, and so rabbis could ponder the more unpleasant aspects of Scripture without fearing that it would break their faith entirely.

You don’t even ask whether the incident reflects poorly on God, so there’s no need to quickly blurt out “The ways of God are mysterious!” or “We’re not wise enough to question God’s decisions!” or “Murdering babies is okay when God does it!” That part of the question is just-not-thought-about.

The reason that educated religious people stay religious, I suspect, is that when they doubt, they are subconsciously very careful to attack their own beliefs only at the strongest points—places where they know they can defend. Moreover, places where rehearsing the standard defense will feel strengthening.

It probably feels really good, for example, to rehearse one’s prescripted defense for “Doesn’t Science say that the universe is just meaningless atoms bopping around?” because it confirms the meaning of the universe and how it flows from God, etc. Much more comfortable to think about than an illiterate Egyptian mother wailing over the crib of her slaughtered son. Anyone who spontaneously thinks about the latter, when questioning their faith in Judaism, is really questioning it, and is probably not going to stay Jewish much longer.

My point here is not just to beat up on Orthodox Judaism. I’m sure that there’s some reply or other for the Slaying of the Firstborn, and probably a dozen of them. My point is that, when it comes to spontaneous self-questioning, one is much more likely to spontaneously self-attack strong points with comforting replies to rehearse, than to spontaneously self-attack the weakest, most vulnerable points. Similarly, one is likely to stop at the first reply and be comforted, rather than further criticizing the reply. A better title than “Avoiding Your Belief’s Real Weak Points” would be “Not Spontaneously Thinking About Your Belief’s Most Painful Weaknesses.”

More than anything, the grip of religion is sustained by people just-not-thinking-about the real weak points of their religion. I don’t think this is a matter of training, but a matter of instinct. People don’t think about the real weak points of their beliefs for the same reason they don’t touch an oven’s red-hot burners; it’s painful.

To do better: When you’re doubting one of your most cherished beliefs, close your eyes, empty your mind, grit your teeth, and deliberately think about whatever hurts the most. Don’t rehearse standard objections whose standard counters would make you feel better. Ask yourself what smart people who disagree would say to your first reply, and your second reply. Whenever you catch yourself flinching away from an objection you fleetingly thought of, drag it out into the forefront of your mind. Punch yourself in the solar plexus. Stick a knife in your heart, and wiggle to widen the hole. In the face of the pain, rehearse only this:<sup>1</sup>

> What is true is already so.
> 
> Owning up to it doesn’t make it worse.
> 
> Not being open about it doesn’t make it go away.
> 
> And because it’s true, it is what is there to be interacted with.
> 
> Anything untrue isn’t there to be lived.
> 
> People can stand what is true,
> 
> for they are already enduring it.
