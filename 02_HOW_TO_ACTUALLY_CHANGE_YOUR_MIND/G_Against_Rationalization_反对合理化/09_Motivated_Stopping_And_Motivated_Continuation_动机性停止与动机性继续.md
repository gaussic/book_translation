## 动机驱动的停止与动机驱动的继续

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

虽然我不完全认同“快速与节俭”（Fast and Frugal）学派的某些观点——在我看来，他们有时过于“把柠檬变成柠檬汽水”了——但我也认为，他们发展出了在所有决策理论流派中最符合心理现实的模型。大多数实验是向被试呈现选项，然后被试做出选择，实验结果便到此为止。而节俭学派意识到，在现实生活中，人们必须**自己**生成选项，于是他们研究了人们是如何生成这些选项的。

同样，尽管许多实验将证据“端上了银盘”，现实中你必须自己去**搜集证据**，这可能代价高昂，而且你还必须在某个时点判断自己是否已经获得了足够的证据，是否可以停止搜索并做出决策。当你在买房时，你并不会一开始就被提供恰好十套房子供你选择，也不会在允许你决定前被带去一一参观。你会看一套房子，再看另一套，并彼此比较；你会调整自己的期望——重新考虑自己**究竟**多需要靠近工作地点、**究竟**愿意支付多少；你会决定接下来看哪一套房子；最后你会在某个时点决定你已经看得差不多了，作出选择。

Gilovich 曾将**动机性怀疑（motivated skepticism）**和**动机性轻信（motivated credulity）**区分开来，指出人们对**不愿相信的结论**会施加更高的证据标准，而对**愿意相信的结论**则更容易接受。一个动机性怀疑者会问：“证据是否**迫使我**接受这个结论？”而一个动机性轻信者会问：“证据是否**允许我**接受这个结论？”

我想提出一个类似的偏差，在心理真实的搜索行为中表现为：**动机驱动的停止**与**动机驱动的继续**。当我们**有隐藏动机去选择当前“最优”选项**时，我们就会有隐藏动机去**停止搜索并作出选择**，从而**拒绝继续考虑更多的选项**。而当我们**有隐藏动机去排斥当前最优选项**时，我们就会有隐藏动机去**延后判断、继续搜寻证据、生成更多选项**——试图找到任何事情来替代当前这个让人不舒服的结论。

统计学史上有个著名的丑闻：该领域的重要奠基人 R.A. Fisher 坚称吸烟与肺癌之间没有建立因果关系。他在国会作证说：“相关性不是因果性。”他提出，也许吸烟者有某种基因，既使他们倾向于吸烟，也使他们倾向于得肺癌。

或者，也许是因为 Fisher 被烟草公司雇佣为顾问，他就产生了一个**隐藏动机**，去认定“已有的证据不够充分”，于是最好“继续查找更多证据”。Fisher 本人也是个烟民，1962 年死于结肠癌。<sup>1</sup>

像许多其他形式的动机性怀疑一样，**动机驱动的继续**也会伪装成“美德的理性行为”。谁会反对“多收集些证据”呢？<sup>2</sup>

我会反对。收集证据往往**代价高昂**，更糟的是**需要时间**，而且，**拒绝整合已有证据**并不是一种什么“高尚”的行为。你**总是可以**之后再改变主意。<sup>3</sup>

至于**动机驱动的停止**，它出现在每一个**害怕第三种选择**的地方，出现在你拥有一个明显反驳却不愿意面对它的观点时，也出现在其他许多地方。当你采取某种行动仅仅是因为“做点什么”让你感觉良好，于是你不愿去调查这个计划到底有没有实际效果——因为你害怕那种付出金钱换来的“道德满足感”被破坏。<sup>4</sup> 只要你的信念与预期不一致，你就会对任何新证据产生恐惧，而这正是**动机驱动的停止**发挥作用的地方。<sup>5</sup>

这篇文章的寓意是：**决定终止一个搜索过程（不论是暂时还是永久）本身，就像搜索过程一样，也会受到偏差与隐藏动机的影响**。当你在做出一个令人舒服的结论后就关闭了搜索，然而还有很多便宜又快捷的证据尚未搜集——你还没去查网站、还没认真思考反驳观点、甚至连闭上眼睛静想五分钟有没有更好的选择都没有做时——你就该怀疑自己是不是**动机驱动地停止了搜索**。当有些证据已经在某种方向上倾斜，但你不喜欢那个方向，于是你声称还需要更多证据——而且是你**明知**自己短期内不可能获取的那种昂贵证据，而不是你可以在半小时内用 Google 查到的——你就该怀疑自己是不是**动机驱动地延续了搜索**，以逃避不愿面对的不适。

## Motivated Stopping and Motivated Continuation

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

While I disagree with some views of the Fast and Frugal crowd—in my opinion they make a few too many lemons into lemonade—it also seems to me that they tend to develop the most psychologically realistic models of any school of decision theory. Most experiments present the subjects with options, and the subject chooses an option, and that’s the experimental result. The frugalists realized that in real life, you have to generate your options, and they studied how subjects did that.

Likewise, although many experiments present evidence on a silver platter, in real life you have to gather evidence, which may be costly, and at some point decide that you have enough evidence to stop and choose. When you’re buying a house, you don’t get exactly ten houses to choose from, and you aren’t led on a guided tour of all of them before you’re allowed to decide anything. You look at one house, and another, and compare them to each other; you adjust your aspirations—reconsider how much you really need to be close to your workplace and how much you’re really willing to pay; you decide which house to look at next; and at some point you decide that you’ve seen enough houses, and choose.

Gilovich’s distinction between motivated skepticism and motivated credulity highlights how conclusions a person does not want to believe are held to a higher standard than conclusions a person wants to believe. A motivated skeptic asks if the evidence compels them to accept the conclusion; a motivated credulist asks if the evidence allows them to accept the conclusion.

I suggest that an analogous bias in psychologically realistic search is motivated stopping and motivated continuation: when we have a hidden motive for choosing the “best” current option, we have a hidden motive to stop, and choose, and reject consideration of any more options. When we have a hidden motive to reject the current best option, we have a hidden motive to suspend judgment pending additional evidence, to generate more options—to find something, anything, to do instead of coming to a conclusion.

A major historical scandal in statistics was R. A. Fisher, an eminent founder of the field, insisting that no causal link had been established between smoking and lung cancer. “Correlation is not causation,” he testified to Congress. Perhaps smokers had a gene which both predisposed them to smoke and predisposed them to lung cancer.

Or maybe Fisher’s being employed as a consultant for tobacco firms gave him a hidden motive to decide that the evidence already gathered was insufficient to come to a conclusion, and it was better to keep looking. Fisher was also a smoker himself, and died of colon cancer in 1962.<sup>1</sup>

Like many other forms of motivated skepticism, motivated continuation can try to disguise itself as virtuous rationality. Who can argue against gathering more evidence?<sup>2</sup>

I can. Evidence is often costly, and worse, slow, and there is certainly nothing virtuous about refusing to integrate the evidence you already have. You can always change your mind later.<sup>3</sup>

As for motivated stopping, it appears in every place a third alternative is feared, and wherever you have an argument whose obvious counterargument you would rather not see, and in other places as well. It appears when you pursue a course of action that makes you feel good just for acting, and so you’d rather not investigate how well your plan really worked, for fear of destroying the warm glow of moral satisfaction you paid good money to purchase.<sup>4</sup> It appears wherever your beliefs and anticipations get out of sync, so you have a reason to fear any new evidence gathered.<sup>5</sup>

The moral is that the decision to terminate a search procedure (temporarily or permanently) is, like the search procedure itself, subject to bias and hidden motives. You should suspect motivated stopping when you close off search, after coming to a comfortable conclusion, and yet there’s a lot of fast cheap evidence you haven’t gathered yet—there are websites you could visit, there are counter-counter arguments you could consider, or you haven’t closed your eyes for five minutes by the clock trying to think of a better option. You should suspect motivated continuation when some evidence is leaning in a way you don’t like, but you decide that more evidence is needed—expensive evidence that you know you can’t gather anytime soon, as opposed to something you’re going to look up on Google in thirty minutes—before you’ll have to do anything uncomfortable.
