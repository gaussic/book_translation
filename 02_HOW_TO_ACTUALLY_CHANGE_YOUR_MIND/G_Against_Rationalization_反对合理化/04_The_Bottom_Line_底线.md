## 底线

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky


有两个密封的箱子即将被拍卖，箱子 A 和箱子 B。其中**只有一个**箱子里藏有一颗珍贵的钻石。我们可以依靠各种迹象和预兆来判断哪个箱子里有钻石；但没有哪一个迹象是我**确信百分之百可靠**的。比如，有一个箱子上有蓝色印章，而我知道有钻石的箱子比空箱子**更可能**带有蓝色印章。或者，一个箱子表面很光亮，而我**怀疑**（但不确定）有钻石的箱子从不会是发亮的。

现在，假设有一个聪明的辩手手里拿着一张纸，对箱子 A 和箱子 B 的持有者说：“竞标吧。谁赢得了我的服务，我就为谁辩护，说他们的箱子里有钻石，从而让这个箱子卖个好价钱。”于是两位箱主开始出价，B 箱的持有者出价更高，赢得了这位聪明辩手的服务。

这位聪明辩手开始组织他的思路。他首先在纸的**最底部**写下：“因此，B 箱中含有钻石！”然后，在纸的顶部，他写上：“B 箱有蓝色印章”，接着写下：“A 箱发亮”，再写：“B 箱比 A 箱更轻”，等等，一连串的迹象和预兆；但他**故意忽略**所有可能支持 A 箱的迹象。接着，这位辩手来到我面前，开始从他的纸上朗读：“B 箱有蓝色印章，A 箱发亮……”，一直到最后：“因此，B 箱中含有钻石。”

但请思考这一点：当这位聪明辩手写下他结论的那一刻——他把墨水写到纸上的那一刻——这份物理墨迹与那些物理箱子的**证据纠缠关系**已经被固定了。

你可以设想一个“多世界”的集合——不管你叫它 Everett 分支还是 Tegmark 的复制宇宙——在这些宇宙中，有一个**客观的频率**，指的是 A 箱或 B 箱含钻石的概率。<sup>1</sup>

纸上的墨水形成了奇怪的形状和弯曲线条，它们组合成了这样的文字：“因此，B 箱中含有钻石。”如果你刚好是个识字的英语读者，你可能会因此而产生混淆，误以为这种墨水的形状**真的意味着**B 箱中有钻石。心理实验中，如果让被试说出印刷图像的颜色，而显示的单词是“Green”（绿色）但用红色墨水印刷，人们常常会说“绿色”而不是“红色”。这种时候，如果你**不识字**，反而更有帮助，因为你不会被墨水的形状所误导。

对我们来说，事物的真正意义在于它**与其他事物的纠缠关系**。再次设想那个多世界的集合，无论是 Everett 分支还是 Tegmark 的平行宇宙。当所有世界中的聪明辩手同时在他们纸张的底部写下那句结论时——假设这是同一时刻——这个墨水和箱子之间的关联已经被固定。辩手使用不可擦的墨水写字；墨迹不会变。箱子的内容也不会变。在那些墨水写着“因此，B 箱中含有钻石”的世界子集中，其中某个**固定百分比**的世界中其实是 A 箱含有钻石。无论你在上面的空白行写下什么理由，这一点**都不会改变**。

所以，墨水的“证据纠缠性”已经被锁定了，至于它到底代表什么，那就留给你判断吧。也许，那些相信自己理由更充分的箱主，更倾向于雇佣宣传者；也可能，那些对自己箱子没有信心的持有者，会出更高的价钱来掩盖这一点。如果箱主们根本不理解这些迹象和预兆，那么这段墨迹就**与箱子的实际内容毫无关联**，不过它可能能告诉你一些关于箱主的财务状况和竞标习惯的信息。

现在再假设现场还有另一个人，他是真正**出于好奇**的。他先在纸上如实记录下两个箱子的所有不同迹象，然后用自己的知识和概率定律，最后在底部写道：“因此，我估算 B 箱含有钻石的概率为 85%。”这段手写文字是**什么的证据**呢？如果我们回溯这段物理墨迹产生的因果链，会发现它**穿过了所有箱子的迹象和预兆**，而且完全依赖于这些迹象；在别的宇宙里，如果迹象不同，写在底部的概率也会不同。

因此，好奇探究者的笔迹与箱子的迹象和内容**纠缠在一起**；而那位聪明辩手的笔迹，只是某位箱主出价更高的证据。这两种墨迹传达的信息**大相径庭**，虽然一个糊涂的读者可能会觉得，这些英文句子“听起来差不多”。

你作为一个理性主义者的**效能**，取决于到底是**哪种算法**在写下你思维的“底线”。如果你开车时刹车会发出金属尖叫声，但你不愿意面对维修成本，于是决定去寻找各种理由来说服自己“刹车可能没坏”，那你最终在哪些 Everett 分支或 Tegmark 宇宙中幸存下来——也就是你作为理性主义者的实际表现——将取决于那个决定你**想要找哪种结论的算法**。在这个例子中，真正主导你行为的算法是：“永远不要修理贵的东西。”如果这是个好算法，那很好；如果是个坏算法，那就不好。不管怎样，你后来写在“底线”上方的那些论证，都**不会改变这个事实**。

这篇文章的目的是提醒你**如何思考自己在做的推理**，而不是给你提供一个“通用反驳模板”，用来反对那些你不喜欢的结论。确实，说“对方只是个狡猾的辩手”是一种聪明的论点——如果你自己也在花钱让自己维持原有的信念。但请记住，即使是全世界最聪明的辩手指出“太阳在照耀”，它依然很可能只是因为——现在是白天。

## The Bottom Line

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

There are two sealed boxes up for auction, box A and box B. One and only one of these boxes contains a valuable diamond. There are all manner of signs and portents indicating whether a box contains a diamond; but I have no sign which I know to be perfectly reliable. There is a blue stamp on one box, for example, and I know that boxes which contain diamonds are more likely than empty boxes to show a blue stamp. Or one box has a shiny surface, and I have a suspicion—I am not sure—that no diamond-containing box is ever shiny.

Now suppose there is a clever arguer, holding a sheet of paper, and they say to the owners of box A and box B: “Bid for my services, and whoever wins my services, I shall argue that their box contains the diamond, so that the box will receive a higher price.” So the box-owners bid, and box B’s owner bids higher, winning the services of the clever arguer.

The clever arguer begins to organize their thoughts. First, they write, “And therefore, box B contains the diamond!” at the bottom of their sheet of paper. Then, at the top of the paper, the clever arguer writes, “Box B shows a blue stamp,” and beneath it, “Box A is shiny,” and then, “Box B is lighter than box A,” and so on through many signs and portents; yet the clever arguer neglects all those signs which might argue in favor of box A. And then the clever arguer comes to me and recites from their sheet of paper: “Box B shows a blue stamp, and box A is shiny,” and so on, until they reach: “and therefore, box B contains the diamond.”

But consider: At the moment when the clever arguer wrote down their conclusion, at the moment they put ink on their sheet of paper, the evidential entanglement of that physical ink with the physical boxes became fixed.

It may help to visualize a collection of worlds—Everett branches or Tegmark duplicates—within which there is some objective frequency at which box A or box B contains a diamond.<sup>1</sup>

The ink on paper is formed into odd shapes and curves, which look like this text: “And therefore, box B contains the diamond.” If you happened to be a literate English speaker, you might become confused, and think that this shaped ink somehow meant that box B contained the diamond. Subjects instructed to say the color of printed pictures and shown the word Green in red ink often say “green” instead of “red.” It helps to be illiterate, so that you are not confused by the shape of the ink.

To us, the true import of a thing is its entanglement with other things. Consider again the collection of worlds, Everett branches or Tegmark duplicates. At the moment when all clever arguers in all worlds put ink to the bottom line of their paper—let us suppose this is a single moment—it fixed the correlation of the ink with the boxes. The clever arguer writes in non-erasable pen; the ink will not change. The boxes will not change. Within the subset of worlds where the ink says “And therefore, box B contains the diamond,” there is already some fixed percentage of worlds where box A contains the diamond. This will not change regardless of what is written in on the blank lines above.

So the evidential entanglement of the ink is fixed, and I leave to you to decide what it might be. Perhaps box owners who believe a better case can be made for them are more liable to hire advertisers; perhaps box owners who fear their own deficiencies bid higher. If the box owners do not themselves understand the signs and portents, then the ink will be completely unentangled with the boxes’ contents, though it may tell you something about the owners’ finances and bidding habits.

Now suppose another person present is genuinely curious, and they first write down all the distinguishing signs of both boxes on a sheet of paper, and then apply their knowledge and the laws of probability and write down at the bottom: “Therefore, I estimate an 85% probability that box B contains the diamond.” Of what is this handwriting evidence? Examining the chain of cause and effect leading to this physical ink on physical paper, I find that the chain of causality wends its way through all the signs and portents of the boxes, and is dependent on these signs; for in worlds with different portents, a different probability is written at the bottom.

So the handwriting of the curious inquirer is entangled with the signs and portents and the contents of the boxes, whereas the handwriting of the clever arguer is evidence only of which owner paid the higher bid. There is a great difference in the indications of ink, though one who foolishly read aloud the ink-shapes might think the English words sounded similar.

Your effectiveness as a rationalist is determined by whichever algorithm actually writes the bottom line of your thoughts. If your car makes metallic squealing noises when you brake, and you aren’t willing to face up to the financial cost of getting your brakes replaced, you can decide to look for reasons why your car might not need fixing. But the actual percentage of you that survive in Everett branches or Tegmark worlds—which we will take to describe your effectiveness as a rationalist—is determined by the algorithm that decided which conclusion you would seek arguments for. In this case, the real algorithm is “Never repair anything expensive.” If this is a good algorithm, fine; if this is a bad algorithm, oh well. The arguments you write afterward, above the bottom line, will not change anything either way.

This is intended as a caution for your own thinking, not a Fully General Counterargument against conclusions you don’t like. For it is indeed a clever argument to say “My opponent is a clever arguer,” if you are paying yourself to retain whatever beliefs you had at the start. The world’s cleverest arguer may point out that the Sun is shining, and yet it is still probably daytime.
