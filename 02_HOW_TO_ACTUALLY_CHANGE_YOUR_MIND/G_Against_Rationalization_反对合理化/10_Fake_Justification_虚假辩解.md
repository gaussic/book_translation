## 虚假辩解

**作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky**

许多已经不再真正信仰基督教的人，如今却坚持声称他们尊崇《圣经》是因为它提供了伦理指导。对此，无神论者通常的回应是山姆·哈里斯的那句：“你我都知道，我们只需要五分钟就能写出一本比《圣经》更连贯、更富同情心的道德指南。”<sup>1</sup>
同样的，有些人坚持说《圣经》作为文学作品是有价值的。那么为什么不去崇敬《魔戒》呢？作为文学作品它远远胜过《圣经》。尽管人们也常批评托尔金的道德观，《魔戒》至少在伦理指导上也比《圣经》强。那么，为什么人们不在脖子上挂一个小戒指，而是戴十字架？甚至连《哈利·波特》都比《圣经》更像一部文学艺术作品，也更像一本道德哲学书。<sup>2</sup>

你问你的朋友：“你怎么能花100万美元去买一个镶满宝石的笔记本电脑？而那么多人连一台电脑都没有。”你朋友却说：“但想想这能带来多少就业机会——笔记本的制造商，他们的广告公司——然后他们会去吃饭、剪头发，这会刺激经济，最终很多人都会拥有自己的电脑。”但如果真想做到这一点，更高效的方法是购买5000台“每个孩子一台电脑”计划的笔记本电脑——这既能提供就业，又能直接把电脑送到人们手中。

我以前提到过，很多人没能寻找“第三种选择”。但这其实甚至不是出于“动机停止”（motivated stopping）。称其为“动机停止”还意味着至少曾经有过寻找的过程。

在《结论优先》中，我指出，只有我们**信念的真实决定因素**，才可能影响我们在现实世界中的准确度。只有我们**行为的真实决定因素**，才能影响我们实现目标的有效性。那个买了百万美元笔记本的人，真正的想法其实是：“哇，好闪！”——这才是他们做出这个决定的真实因果路径。任何“辩解”都无法改变这个事实，除非那个辩解是一场真正正在运行、能改变结论的新思考过程。**真正**改变这个结论。多数出于责任感的批判，其实更像是形式上的检查，就像一党制国家的自由选举。

如果你真的想以文学价值来为《圣经》赢得赞誉，那你就得以某种中立的方式阅读一系列候选书籍，直到你找到文学质量最高的那本。知名度是筛选候选书的一个合理标准，因此我想你最后确实可能会读到莎士比亚、《圣经》和《哥德尔、艾舍尔、巴赫》。
（否则，从百万本书中碰巧找到《圣经》当候选人，也太巧了。）
但真正的困难，在于所谓“中立阅读”的那部分。如果你不是基督徒，倒还简单；但如果你是……

不过当然，现实中根本没有发生这样的搜索过程。打着“文学质量”的旗号，为“我♡圣经”的结论辩护，其实是在篡改历史，就像把猫奶当牛奶卖一样。这根本不是得出那个结论的真实路径。

如果你真的让批评有可能推翻你的结论——如果那个批评**真的有那种力量**——那就会改变你得出结论的“真实算法”。这会改变你在可能世界中与那个结论的关联方式。但人们大大高估了自己真正可能改变想法的概率。

满大街都说自己“头脑开放”，可信念更新怎么这么稀少？

让我猜猜：是的，你承认你最初决定买那台百万美元的笔记本时，是因为你心想“哇，好闪！”是的，你也承认这不是一个与你目标一致的决策过程。但你后来决定，你应该用钱来尽可能地帮助那些没有电脑的人获得电脑。可是呢，你竟然找不到比买这台镶钻笔记本**更有效**的方式来做到这一点——因为你是在给笔记本商店送钱，刺激经济嘛！这你怎么能打败！

朋友，我对这种惊人的巧合表示严重怀疑。我严重怀疑：在这个美好、理性、利他主义的标准X下，“最优解”恰好就是那个最开始从完全不相关、无法辩护的过程Y里蹦出来的点子。如果你不觉得掷骰子能给出正确答案，那你凭什么相信别的非理性认知方式能呢？

你用了错误的推理，却没有犯错？这不太可能。

## Fake Justification

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Many Christians who’ve stopped really believing now insist that they revere the Bible as a source of ethical advice. The standard atheist reply is given by Sam Harris: “You and I both know that it would take us five minutes to produce a book that offers a more coherent and compassionate morality than the Bible does.”<sup>1</sup> Similarly, one may try to insist that the Bible is valuable as a literary work. Then why not revere Lord of the Rings, a vastly superior literary work? And despite the standard criticisms of Tolkien’s morality, Lord of the Rings is at least superior to the Bible as a source of ethics. So why don’t people wear little rings around their neck, instead of crosses? Even Harry Potter is superior to the Bible, both as a work of literary art and as moral philosophy.<sup>2</sup>

“How can you justify buying a $1 million gem-studded laptop,” you ask your friend, “when so many people have no laptops at all?” And your friend says, “But think of the employment that this will provide—to the laptop maker, the laptop maker’s advertising agency—and then they’ll buy meals and haircuts—it will stimulate the economy and eventually many people will get their own laptops.” But it would be even more efficient to buy 5,000 One Laptop Per Child laptops, thus providing employment to the OLPC manufacturers and giving out laptops directly.

I’ve touched before on the failure to look for third alternatives. But this is not really motivated stopping. Calling it “motivated stopping” would imply that there was a search carried out in the first place.

In “The Bottom Line,” I observed that only the real determinants of our beliefs can ever influence our real-world accuracy. Only the real determinants of our actions can influence our effectiveness in achieving our goals. Someone who buys a million-dollar laptop was really thinking, “Ooh, shiny,” and that was the one true causal history of their decision to buy a laptop. No amount of “justification” can change this, unless the justification is a genuine, newly running search process that can change the conclusion. Really change the conclusion. Most criticism carried out from a sense of duty is more of a token inspection than anything else. Free elections in a one-party country.

To genuinely justify the Bible as an object of laudation by reference to its literary quality, you would have to somehow perform a neutral reading through candidate books until you found the book of highest literary quality. Renown is one reasonable criterion for generating candidates, so I suppose you could legitimately end up reading Shakespeare, the Bible, and Gödel, Escher, Bach. (Otherwise it would be quite a coincidence to find the Bible as a candidate, among a million other books.) The real difficulty is in that “neutral reading” part. Easy enough if you’re not a Christian, but if you are . . .

But of course nothing like this happened. No search ever occurred. Writing the justification of “literary quality” above the bottom line of “I ♡ the Bible” is a historical misrepresentation of how the bottom line really got there, like selling cat milk as cow milk. That is just not where the bottom line really came from. That is just not what originally happened to produce that conclusion.

If you genuinely subject your conclusion to a criticism that can potentially de-conclude it—if the criticism genuinely has that power—then that does modify “the real algorithm behind” your conclusion. It changes the entanglement of your conclusion over possible worlds. But people overestimate, by far, how likely they really are to change their minds.

With all those open minds out there, you’d think there’d be more belief-updating.

Let me guess: Yes, you admit that you originally decided you wanted to buy a million-dollar laptop by thinking, “Ooh, shiny.” Yes, you concede that this isn’t a decision process consonant with your stated goals. But since then, you’ve decided that you really ought to spend your money in such fashion as to provide laptops to as many laptopless wretches as possible. And yet you just couldn’t find any more efficient way to do this than buying a million-dollar diamond-studded laptop—because, hey, you’re giving money to a laptop store and stimulating the economy! Can’t beat that!

My friend, I am damned suspicious of this amazing coincidence. I am damned suspicious that the best answer under this lovely, rational, altruistic criterion X, is also the idea that just happened to originally pop out of the unrelated indefensible process Y. If you don’t think that rolling dice would have been likely to produce the correct answer, then how likely is it to pop out of any other irrational cognition?

It’s improbable that you used mistaken reasoning, yet made no mistakes.
