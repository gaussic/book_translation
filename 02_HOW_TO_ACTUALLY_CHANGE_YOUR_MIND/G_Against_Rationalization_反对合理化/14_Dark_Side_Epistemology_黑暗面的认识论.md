## 黑暗面的认识论

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

**“你若说出一次谎言，从此真相便与你为敌。”**

我曾讨论过“谎言具有传染性”这一概念。如果你从车道上捡起一块鹅卵石，然后告诉地质学家你在海滩上捡的——你知道地质学家对岩石了解多少吗？我不知道。但我可以猜测，一块被水冲刷过的鹅卵石，不会看起来像是火山爆发后冷却的熔岩滴。你知道你车道上的石头到底是从哪儿来的吗？在一个遵循自然规律的宇宙中，事物总带有它们出处的痕迹；而谎言，在这张因果之网中，显得格格不入。<sup>1</sup>

在一个人的眼中，某个看似可以用“合理谎言”替代的“随意真理”，在另一个更有知识者看来，可能早已被十几条因果链牢牢钉死。对一位创造论者来说，“智能设计”取代“自然选择”的想法，可能像是在为自己喜欢的球队加油。但对一位生物学家来说，要合理地主张某个生物是被智能设计的，几乎意味着要对该生物的每一个方面都撒谎。想要合理地宣称“人类是智能设计的”，你必须对人类视网膜的结构撒谎，对人脑的构造撒谎，对那些靠弱范德华力而非强共价键结合的蛋白质撒谎……

或者，你也可以选择另一条路：撒谎关于进化论本身——这正是大多数创造论者的选择。他们不是撒谎关于因果网络中的具体节点，而是撒谎关于连接这些节点的一般规律。

接着，为了掩盖这一点，他们还要撒谎关于科学的规则——比如，“理论”是什么意思，或科学家说自己“不绝对确定”时到底是什么意思。

所以他们从撒谎关于具体事实，发展到撒谎关于一般规律，最终撒谎关于推理的规则。想要否认人类是进化而来的，你就必须否认进化；而为了否认进化，你又必须否认那些规范我们理解进化的科学规则。

但还有别的选择吗？正如一个人类若出现在由真正智能设计的生命体组成的社会中，会显得格格不入，而你必须撒谎关于进化的规则才能掩盖这一事实，同样地，创造论的信念在科学中本就是不合时宜的——你不会在一个头脑清明的人那里看到这种信念，就像你不会在冰川上看到棕榈树。所以你必须破坏那些原本会排斥这些信念的障碍。

这就引出了**自我欺骗**的问题。

当你对自己撒一个谎，在你还不了解思维的规则——甚至不知道**思维有规则**——时，这个谎可能看起来还挺合理，就像选一个冰淇淋口味那么随意，就像海滩上孤零零的一块石子……

……直到有一天，有人用他们学到的推理规则质疑你的信念。他们问你：“你有什么证据？”

你说：“什么？我为什么需要证据？”

他们回答：“通常来说，信念是需要证据支持的。”

显然，这句话是“敌方士兵”，你必须击败它。于是你说：“我不同意！并非所有信念都需要证据。特别是，关于龙的信念不需要证据。关于龙的问题，你可以相信任何你想相信的。所以，我不需要证据就可以相信我车库里有一条龙。”

对方说：“哈？你不能就这样把‘龙’排除在规则之外。‘信念需要证据’这条规则背后是有原因的。画一张正确的城市地图，你必须走过街道，根据你看到的东西在纸上画线。这不是某种随意的法律要求——如果你只是坐在客厅里随便画几条线，那地图十有八九是错的。对龙的地图也一样，这跟画别的地图没有区别。”

于是，现在这个解释“为什么信念需要证据”的道理也成了敌军士兵。于是你说：“你说十有八九是错的？那说明还有点希望嘛，对吧？我就不信，只要不是**百分之百确定**，我就不必须相信。”

也许你甚至开始**自己**怀疑起来：“信念需要证据”这个道理似乎有点道理。但这动摇了你珍藏的一条谎言，于是你拒绝心中的晨曦，把太阳重新压回地平线之下。

又或者，你早就听过“信念需要证据”这句格言，也觉得它挺有智慧，还曾在公众场合引用过。但直到有人点出它也适用于你对车库中那条龙的信念时，你才意识到问题。于是你反应迅速，说：“龙属于另一个‘权威领域’（magisterium）。”

拥有错误的信念本身并非绝症——只要你在发现错误后能改正。真正危险的是：你不只拥有一个错误的信念，还认为这个错误信念**应当被保护**——即使你自己都不怎么信，它仍被你作为“值得信”的东西而保护着。

一个**必须被保护的谎言**，可能阻碍一个人迈入更高层次的理性之路。这可不是无伤大雅的“娱乐”。

正如现实远比表面看起来更复杂，理性思维的规则也远比初学者所想的更严格。这世界是由一般规律紧密编织而成的，我们的合理信念亦然。

想象一下，如果你想否认进化论或日心说，你要放弃多少相关的真理、否认多少背后的自然法则。然后你就能理解，一个自我欺骗行为，是如何在你试图探索真相时，因害怕看到其连锁反应而屏蔽掉整个元层级的思考，禁止你通往理性之道的各个中级与高级关卡。于是你在脑中构建了一整套“反规律”的体系，一整套“反思维”的规则，一整套“合理化不真实”的方法论。

Steven Kaas 曾说：“传播不够准确的信念，是一种破坏行为。除非你也愿意去扎破别人的轮胎，否则就不要这么做。” 如果你给了某人一个错误的信念，还让他相信这个信念本身值得保护——那除非你也愿意给他做额叶切除手术，否则就别这么干。

一旦你说了一个谎言，真相就成了你的敌人；而那个真相所关联的所有真理、真理的所有盟友，都会变成你必须抗拒的力量。无论你是欺骗他人，还是欺骗自己。

你必须否认信念需要证据，接着你必须否认“地图应当反映地形”，最后你甚至必须否认“真理是一件好事”……

于是，“黑暗面”就这样诞生了。

我担心，人们对它毫无察觉，或者警觉不够——在我们这个人类世界中，我们是注定要遇到系统性糟糕的认识论的。

你听到的那些“如何思考”的流行语，那些“深奥智慧”的缓存思维——有些确实是理性主义者的良好建议。但其他一些，不过是用来保护某个谎言或自我欺骗的工具：它们源自黑暗面。

比如，“每个人都有权持有自己的观点。”当你细想这句话，这句格言最初是从什么语境中诞生的？是为了保护某个真理？还是为了保护**不想面对的真相**？但人们并不会一下子警觉：“啊哈！我感受到了黑暗面的气息！” 据我观察，大多数人并没有意识到黑暗面就潜伏在我们中间。

但还有别的可能吗？只要有人在保护谎言或自欺的信念，这个**必须被保护的谎言**就会像病毒一样，递归传播至因果网络、一般经验法则、推理规则，乃至这些规则背后的理解结构中。如果世界上存在良好的认识论，而又有人试图保护谎言与自欺，那自然也会产生与之对抗的坏认识论。我们怎么能指望在这个世界上，只存在光明面而没有黑暗面？有阳光，自然


也有那背对阳光所投下的阴影。

请注意，我并不是说这些人都是“坏人”。大多数人传播“深奥智慧”，更多是被欺骗者，而非欺骗者；更多是自欺者，而非有意欺人。我想。

我当然也无意为你提供某种“万用反驳法”，让你可以一看到不喜欢的认识论，就说：“哦，这一定是黑暗面捏造的。”在光明面的规则中，有一条就是你必须针对**命题本身**进行驳斥，而不是通过攻击其提出者的动机来否定它。

但黑暗面确实存在。通向它的道路是恐惧，而一次背叛就可能令你堕入其中。并不是所有穿袍子的人都是绝地武士或骗子；有些人是西斯尊主，还有他们不自知的学徒。谨记这一点，保持警觉。

至于由黑暗面所催生的那些常见流行语（不是随便的错误信念，而是**坏认识论**，是“失败的通用借口”）——亲爱的读者，你愿意试着列举几条吗？

## Dark Side Epistemology

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

If you once tell a lie, the truth is ever after your enemy.

I have discussed the notion that lies are contagious. If you pick up a pebble from the driveway, and tell a geologist that you found it on a beach—well, do you know what a geologist knows about rocks? I don’t. But I can suspect that a water-worn pebble wouldn’t look like a droplet of frozen lava from a volcanic eruption. Do you know where the pebble in your driveway really came from? Things bear the marks of their places in a lawful universe; in that web, a lie is out of place.<sup>1</sup>

What sounds like an arbitrary truth to one mind—one that could easily be replaced by a plausible lie—might be nailed down by a dozen linkages to the eyes of greater knowledge. To a creationist, the idea that life was shaped by “intelligent design” instead of “natural selection” might sound like a sports team to cheer for. To a biologist, plausibly arguing that an organism was intelligently designed would require lying about almost every facet of the organism. To plausibly argue that “humans” were intelligently designed, you’d have to lie about the design of the human retina, the architecture of the human brain, the proteins bound together by weak van der Waals forces instead of strong covalent bonds . . .

Or you could just lie about evolutionary theory, which is the path taken by most creationists. Instead of lying about the connected nodes in the network, they lie about the general laws governing the links.

And then to cover that up, they lie about the rules of science—like what it means to call something a “theory,” or what it means for a scientist to say that they are not absolutely certain.

So they pass from lying about specific facts, to lying about general laws, to lying about the rules of reasoning. To lie about whether humans evolved, you must lie about evolution; and then you have to lie about the rules of science that constrain our understanding of evolution.

But how else? Just as a human would be out of place in a community of actually intelligently designed life forms, and you have to lie about the rules of evolution to make it appear otherwise, so too beliefs about creationism are themselves out of place in science—you wouldn’t find them in a well-ordered mind any more than you’d find palm trees growing on a glacier. And so you have to disrupt the barriers that would forbid them.

Which brings us to the case of self-deception.

A single lie you tell yourself may seem plausible enough, when you don’t know any of the rules governing thoughts, or even that there are rules; and the choice seems as arbitrary as choosing a flavor of ice cream, as isolated as a pebble on the shore . . .

. . . but then someone calls you on your belief, using the rules of reasoning that they’ve learned. They say, “Where’s your evidence?”

And you say, “What? Why do I need evidence?”

So they say, “In general, beliefs require evidence.”

This argument, clearly, is a soldier fighting on the other side, which you must defeat. So you say: “I disagree! Not all beliefs require evidence. In particular, beliefs about dragons don’t require evidence. When it comes to dragons, you’re allowed to believe anything you like. So I don’t need evidence to believe there’s a dragon in my garage.”

And the one says, “Eh? You can’t just exclude dragons like that. There’s a reason for the rule that beliefs require evidence. To draw a correct map of the city, you have to walk through the streets and make lines on paper that correspond to what you see. That’s not an arbitrary legal requirement—if you sit in your living room and draw lines on the paper at random, the map’s going to be wrong. With extremely high probability. That’s as true of a map of a dragon as it is of anything.”

So now this, the explanation of why beliefs require evidence, is also an opposing soldier. So you say: “Wrong with extremely high probability? Then there’s still a chance, right? I don’t have to believe if it’s not absolutely certain.”

Or maybe you even begin to suspect, yourself, that “beliefs require evidence.” But this threatens a lie you hold precious; so you reject the dawn inside you, push the Sun back under the horizon.

Or you’ve previously heard the proverb “beliefs require evidence,” and it sounded wise enough, and you endorsed it in public. But it never quite occurred to you, until someone else brought it to your attention, that this proverb could apply to your belief that there’s a dragon in your garage. So you think fast and say, “The dragon is in a separate magisterium.”

Having false beliefs isn’t a good thing, but it doesn’t have to be permanently crippling—if, when you discover your mistake, you get over it. The dangerous thing is to have a false belief that you believe should be protected as a belief—a belief-in-belief, whether or not accompanied by actual belief.

A single Lie That Must Be Protected can block someone’s progress into advanced rationality. No, it’s not harmless fun.

Just as the world itself is more tangled by far than it appears on the surface, so too there are stricter rules of reasoning, constraining belief more strongly, than the untrained would suspect. The world is woven tightly, governed by general laws, and so are rational beliefs.

Think of what it would take to deny evolution or heliocentrism—all the connected truths and governing laws you wouldn’t be allowed to know. Then you can imagine how a single act of self-deception can block off the whole meta level of truth-seeking, once your mind begins to be threatened by seeing the connections. Forbidding all the intermediate and higher levels of the rationalist’s Art. Creating, in its stead, a vast complex of anti-law, rules of anti-thought, general justifications for believing the untrue.

Steven Kaas said, “Promoting less than maximally accurate beliefs is an act of sabotage. Don’t do it to anyone unless you’d also slash their tires.” Giving someone a false belief to protect—convincing them that the belief itself must be defended from any thought that seems to threaten it—well, you shouldn’t do that to someone unless you’d also give them a frontal lobotomy.

Once you tell a lie, the truth is your enemy; and every truth connected to that truth, and every ally of truth in general; all of these you must oppose, to protect the lie. Whether you’re lying to others, or to yourself.

You have to deny that beliefs require evidence, and then you have to deny that maps should reflect territories, and then you have to deny that truth is a good thing . . .

Thus comes into being the Dark Side.

I worry that people aren’t aware of it, or aren’t sufficiently wary—that as we wander through our human world, we can expect to encounter systematically bad epistemology.

The “how to think” memes floating around, the cached thoughts of Deep Wisdom—some of it will be good advice devised by rationalists. But other notions were invented to protect a lie or self-deception: spawned from the Dark Side.

“Everyone has a right to their own opinion.” When you think about it, where was that proverb generated? Is it something that someone would say in the course of protecting a truth, or in the course of protecting from the truth? But people don’t perk up and say, “Aha! I sense the presence of the Dark Side!” As far as I can tell, it’s not widely realized that the Dark Side is out there.

But how else? Whether you’re deceiving others, or just yourself, the Lie That Must Be Protected will propagate recursively through the network of empirical causality, and the network of general empirical rules, and the rules of reasoning themselves, and the understanding behind those rules. If there is good epistemology in the world, and also lies or self-deceptions that people are trying to protect, then there will come into existence bad epistemology to counter the good. We could hardly expect, in this world, to find the Light Side without the Dark Side; there is the Sun, and that which shrinks away and generates a cloaking Shadow.

Mind you, these are not necessarily evil people. The vast majority who go about repeating the Deep Wisdom are more duped than duplicitous, more self-deceived than deceiving. I think.

And it’s surely not my intent to offer you a Fully General Counterargument, so that whenever someone offers you some epistemology you don’t like, you say: “Oh, someone on the Dark Side made that up.” It’s one of the rules of the Light Side that you have to refute the proposition for itself, not by accusing its inventor of bad intentions.

But the Dark Side is out there. Fear is the path that leads to it, and one betrayal can turn you. Not all who wear robes are either Jedi or fakes; there are also the Sith Lords, masters and unwitting apprentices. Be warned; be wary.

As for listing common memes that were spawned by the Dark Side—not random false beliefs, mind you, but bad epistemology, the Generic Defenses of Fail—well, would you care to take a stab at it, dear readers?

<sup>1</sup>Actually, a geologist in the comments says that most pebbles in driveways are taken from beaches, so they couldn’t tell the difference between a driveway pebble and a beach pebble, but they could tell the difference between a mountain pebble and a driveway/beach pebble (http://lesswrong.com/lw/uy/dark_side_epistemology/4xbv). Case in point . . .
