## 纠缠的真相，传染的谎言

我几乎可以确定，我们地球上海滩上的一块鹅卵石，并不能揭示地球上的大陆与国家、政治与人民。其他时空中的星球、其他埃弗雷特分支（Everett branches），也可能形成了这块完全相同的鹅卵石。

另一方面，一块鹅卵石的身份，似乎又蕴含着我们的物理定律。从这个意义上说，整个宇宙——包括所有的埃弗雷特分支——都可以由这块鹅卵石所暗示。<sup>1</sup>

通过对这块鹅卵石的研究，你可以观察到物理定律以及它们所蕴含的一切。思考这些物理定律，你会发现行星的形成几乎不可避免，因而可以推测这块鹅卵石来源于某颗行星。鹅卵石内部的晶体结构和分子排列是在重力作用下形成的，这告诉你一些关于这颗行星质量的信息；鹅卵石中元素的混合也透露了它所属行星的形成历史。

我不是地质学家，所以不知道地质学家都掌握哪些奥秘。但我不难想象这样一幕：你拿给一位地质学家一块鹅卵石，然后说，“这块石头来自半月湾（Half Moon Bay）的一处海滩。”地质学家立刻回应道：“这让我很困惑。”甚至可能说：“你撒谎。”也许这块石头的类型就不属于那一带，或鹅卵石的磨损程度不足以说明它来自海滩——我对鹅卵石的了解还不够，无法推断出我可能暴露的那些联系和特征，而这正是重点所在。

“唯有上帝能说出真正可信的谎言。”——我想知道，是否曾经有某个宗教将此视为格言？我（可证伪地）猜想并没有：这是一个理性主义者的观点，哪怕用神学的比喻来表达。说“万物彼此关联，因为上帝创造了整个世界并维系着它”，或许能在布道中营造出温馨感人的氛围，但这在你试图把鹅卵石归属到特定海滩时，并没有太大帮助。

在地球上的一枚便士，对月球施加的引力加速度约为 4.5 × 10⁻³¹ 米每平方秒，从某种意义上讲，说“每一个事件都与其过去的整个光锥（light cone）纠缠在一起”，也算不上太荒唐。由于推理可以在因果网络中向前或向后传播，认知上的纠缠也可以轻易越过光锥的边界。但我可不愿做那个需要通过观察月球来判断那枚便士正反面朝上的法医天文学家——其影响远小于量子不确定性和热噪声。

如果你说，“万物彼此纠缠”，或，“所有事物在推理上是纠缠的，只是某些纠缠比其他更强”，那你可能是真的聪明，而不仅仅是“深奥”地显得聪明。

从物理上讲，每一个事件在某种意义上都是其整个过去光锥的总和，没有明确的边界或界限。但那些**显著的纠缠关系**列表就短得多，而这就形成了一种网络。正是这种高层级的规律性，我称之为“**因果的大网**”（Great Web of Causality）。

我用这些大写字母多少是带点调侃的意味；但如果有什么东西值得用大写来强调，那么“因果的大网”无疑榜上有名。

正如华尔特·司各特爵士说的：“一撒谎，便织出一张纠缠的网。”并不是所有谎言都会失控——我们并不生活在一个如此正义的宇宙中。但确实有时候，一个人为了掩盖一个事实撒了谎，然后又不得不就另一个与之纠缠的事实再撒谎，然后又为了下一个纠缠的事实继续撒谎：

> “你刚才去哪儿了？”
>
> “哦，我出差了。”
>
> “出差的内容是什么？”
>
> “这个我不能说，是和大客户的保密谈判。”
>
> “哇——他们让你参与这种谈判？好消息啊！我得打电话给你老板谢谢他加你进项目。”
>
> “呃……他现在不在办公室……”

人不是神，往往难以想象一个真正可信的谎言所需要扭曲的所有事实。“上帝让我怀孕了”，在那个我们还没弄明白 Y 染色体含义的年代，听起来也许还稍微像回事。如今许多类似的谎言，或许会在基因检测普及后被揭穿。强奸犯因此被定罪，诬告者也被揭露——因为他们没意识到自己留下了可供取证的痕迹。一个研究进化生物学的人，可以在每一只追逐兔子的狼身上、每一只逃跑的兔子、每一只选择蛰人而非发出警告的蜜蜂身上，看出自然选择的设计印记——但我敢肯定，反进化论者们仍然觉得自己的说法听起来很“可信”。

并不是所有谎言都会被揭穿，不是所有骗子都会被惩罚；我们不生活在一个那样正义的宇宙。但并不是所有谎言都像撒谎者自己以为的那样安全。我很好奇：如果某个贝叶斯超级智能用纳米技术对地球进行（无损的？）扫描，会发现多少罪行？至少，它可以识别出任何脑海中还保留有证据的所有谎言。如果神经科学家真的能用神经影像学发明出一种非常优秀的测谎仪，一些谎言可能会更早曝光。保罗·艾克曼（Paul Ekman）——研究微表情的先驱——现在可能就能识别出世界上相当一部分的谎言，只要给他机会。

不是所有谎言都会被揭露，不是所有骗子都会受罚。但“因果之网”的复杂性经常被低估。光是人类目前已知的知识内容，就需要多个人的一生才能完全掌握。任何认为非神之人能撒出一条完美、无风险谎言的人，都低估了“因果之网”的纠缠程度。

诚实是最好的政策吗？我不确定会这么说：即使按我的伦理，有时保持沉默也是可以接受的。但与赤裸裸的谎言相比，诚实或沉默更不容易暴露你未曾察觉的、会不断递归扩散的风险。

## Entangled Truths, Contagious Lies

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

I am reasonably sure that a single pebble, taken from a beach of our own Earth, does not specify the continents and countries, politics and people of this Earth. Other planets in space and time, other Everett branches, would generate the same pebble.

On the other hand, the identity of a single pebble would seem to include our laws of physics. In that sense the entirety of our Universe—all the Everett branches—would be implied by the pebble.<sup>1</sup>

From the study of that single pebble you could see the laws of physics and all they imply. Thinking about those laws of physics, you can see that planets will form, and you can guess that the pebble came from such a planet. The internal crystals and molecular formations of the pebble developed under gravity, which tells you something about the planet’s mass; the mix of elements in the pebble tells you something about the planet’s formation.

I am not a geologist, so I don’t know to which mysteries geologists are privy. But I find it very easy to imagine showing a geologist a pebble, and saying, “This pebble came from a beach at Half Moon Bay,” and the geologist immediately says, “I’m confused,” or even, “You liar.” Maybe it’s the wrong kind of rock, or the pebble isn’t worn enough to be from a beach—I don’t know pebbles well enough to guess the linkages and signatures by which I might be caught, which is the point.

“Only God can tell a truly plausible lie.” I wonder if there was ever a religion that developed this as a proverb? I would (falsifiably) guess not: it’s a rationalist sentiment, even if you cast it in theological metaphor. Saying “everything is interconnected to everything else, because God made the whole world and sustains it” may generate some nice warm ’n’ fuzzy feelings during the sermon, but it doesn’t get you very far when it comes to assigning pebbles to beaches.

A penny on Earth exerts a gravitational acceleration on the Moon of around 4.5 × 10-31 m/s2, so in one sense it’s not too far wrong to say that every event is entangled with its whole past light cone. And since inferences can propagate backward and forward through causal networks, epistemic entanglements can easily cross the borders of light cones. But I wouldn’t want to be the forensic astronomer who had to look at the Moon and figure out whether the penny landed heads or tails—the influence is far less than quantum uncertainty and thermal noise.

If you said, “Everything is entangled with something else,” or, “Everything is inferentially entangled and some entanglements are much stronger than others,” you might be really wise instead of just Deeply Wise.

Physically, each event is in some sense the sum of its whole past light cone, without borders or boundaries. But the list of noticeable entanglements is much shorter, and it gives you something like a network. This high-level regularity is what I refer to when I talk about the Great Web of Causality.

I use these Capitalized Letters somewhat tongue-in-cheek, perhaps; but if anything at all is worth Capitalized Letters, surely the Great Web of Causality makes the list.

“Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practise to deceive,” said Sir Walter Scott. Not all lies spin out of control—we don’t live in so righteous a universe. But it does occasionally happen that someone lies about a fact, and then has to lie about an entangled fact, and then another fact entangled with that one:

> “Where were you?”
> 
> “Oh, I was on a business trip.”
> 
> “What was the business trip about?”
> 
> “I can’t tell you that; it’s proprietary negotiations with a major client.”
> 
> “Oh—they’re letting you in on those? Good news! I should call your boss to thank him for adding you.”
> 
> “Sorry—he’s not in the office right now . . .”

Human beings, who are not gods, often fail to imagine all the facts they would need to distort to tell a truly plausible lie. “God made me pregnant” sounded a tad more likely in the old days before our models of the world contained (quotations of) Y chromosomes. Many similar lies, today, may blow up when genetic testing becomes more common. Rapists have been convicted, and false accusers exposed, years later, based on evidence they didn’t realize they could leave. A student of evolutionary biology can see the design signature of natural selection on every wolf that chases a rabbit; and every rabbit that runs away; and every bee that stings instead of broadcasting a polite warning—but the deceptions of creationists sound plausible to them, I’m sure.

Not all lies are uncovered, not all liars are punished; we don’t live in that righteous a universe. But not all lies are as safe as their liars believe. How many sins would become known to a Bayesian superintelligence, I wonder, if it did a (non-destructive?) nanotechnological scan of the Earth? At minimum, all the lies of which any evidence still exists in any brain. Some such lies may become known sooner than that, if the neuroscientists ever succeed in building a really good lie detector via neuroimaging. Paul Ekman (a pioneer in the study of tiny facial muscle movements) could probably read off a sizeable fraction of the world’s lies right now, given a chance.

Not all lies are uncovered, not all liars are punished. But the Great Web is very commonly underestimated. Just the knowledge that humans have already accumulated would take many human lifetimes to learn. Anyone who thinks that a non-God can tell a perfect lie, risk-free, is underestimating the tangledness of the Great Web.

Is honesty the best policy? I don’t know if I’d go that far: Even on my ethics, it’s sometimes okay to shut up. But compared to outright lies, either honesty or silence involves less exposure to recursively propagating risks you don’t know you’re taking.
