## 虚假正当化

许多已经不再真正信仰基督教的人，现在坚持说他们尊崇《圣经》是因为它能提供道德建议。标准的无神论者回应，正如 Sam Harris 所说：“你我都知道，我们只需五分钟就能写出一本比《圣经》更连贯、更富同情心的道德书。”<sup>1</sup> 同样，有人试图坚持说《圣经》作为文学作品很有价值。那么为什么不去崇拜《魔戒》？它作为文学作品远胜于《圣经》。尽管托尔金的道德观也常被批评，但《魔戒》至少作为道德来源也优于《圣经》。那为什么人们不戴小戒指在脖子上，而是戴十字架？甚至《哈利·波特》无论作为文学艺术还是道德哲学，都比《圣经》更胜一筹。<sup>2</sup>

你问朋友：“你怎么能为买一台价值一百万美元、镶满宝石的笔记本电脑找理由？那么多人连笔记本都没有！”你的朋友回答：“但想想这会为笔记本制造商、广告公司带来多少就业机会——他们还会去吃饭、理发——这会刺激经济，最终很多人都会有自己的笔记本。”但如果你真的想帮助别人，直接买5000台“每个孩子一台笔记本”电脑，既能给制造商带来就业，也能直接送给需要的人，效率不是更高吗？

我以前谈过不去寻找第三种选择的问题。但这其实并不是真正的动机性停止。称之为“动机性停止”意味着至少进行过一次搜索。

在《结论先行》中，我指出，只有我们信念的真实决定因素才能影响我们在现实世界中的准确性。只有我们行为的真实决定因素才能影响我们实现目标的有效性。买一台百万美元笔记本的人，真正的想法其实是“哇，好闪亮”，这才是他们做出这个决定的唯一真实因果链。无论你怎么“正当化”，只要这种正当化不是一个真正的新搜索过程、能改变结论的过程，都无法改变这一点。真正改变结论。大多数出于责任感的批判其实只是象征性检查而已，就像一党制国家的“自由选举”。

如果你真的想以文学价值为理由，正当化对《圣经》的赞美，你就必须以中立的态度通读所有候选书籍，直到找到文学质量最高的那一本。知名度可以作为筛选候选书的合理标准，所以你最终可能会读到莎士比亚、《圣经》和《哥德尔、艾舍尔、巴赫》。否则，在百万本书中恰好选中《圣经》作为候选，未免太巧了。真正的难点在于“中立阅读”这一环节。如果你不是基督徒，这很容易，但如果你是……

但现实中，这样的过程根本没有发生。根本没有进行过任何搜索。把“文学价值”这种正当化写在“我爱圣经”这个结论之上，是对历史的歪曲，就像把猫奶当牛奶卖一样。这根本不是结论真正的来历。那根本不是最初得出这个结论时发生的事。

如果你真的让你的结论接受一种可能推翻它的批判——如果这种批判真的有这种力量——那么这确实会改变你结论背后的“真实算法”。它会改变你结论在可能世界中的纠缠关系。但人们往往高估了自己真的会改变想法的可能性。

如果世上真的有那么多“开放心态”，你会以为大家会更频繁地修正信念。

让我猜猜：是的，你承认你最初决定买百万美元笔记本时，心里想的是“哇，好闪亮”。你也承认这和你宣称的目标并不一致。但你后来决定，自己真的应该把钱花在能让更多没有笔记本的人拥有笔记本的方式上。可你就是找不到比买一台镶钻笔记本更高效的办法——因为你把钱给了笔记本商店，刺激了经济！这理由无懈可击！

朋友，我对这种神奇的巧合感到极其怀疑。我极其怀疑，在这个美好、理性、利他的标准X下，最优答案恰好就是最初由完全无关、站不住脚的过程Y蹦出来的那个想法。如果你觉得掷骰子不太可能得出正确答案，那凭什么相信其他非理性思考就能碰巧得出正确答案？

用错误的推理却从未犯错，这种事几乎不可能。

## Fake Justification

Many Christians who’ve stopped really believing now insist that they revere the Bible as a source of ethical advice. The standard atheist reply is given by Sam Harris: “You and I both know that it would take us five minutes to produce a book that offers a more coherent and compassionate morality than the Bible does.”<sup>1</sup> Similarly, one may try to insist that the Bible is valuable as a literary work. Then why not revere Lord of the Rings, a vastly superior literary work? And despite the standard criticisms of Tolkien’s morality, Lord of the Rings is at least superior to the Bible as a source of ethics. So why don’t people wear little rings around their neck, instead of crosses? Even Harry Potter is superior to the Bible, both as a work of literary art and as moral philosophy.<sup>2</sup>

“How can you justify buying a $1 million gem-studded laptop,” you ask your friend, “when so many people have no laptops at all?” And your friend says, “But think of the employment that this will provide—to the laptop maker, the laptop maker’s advertising agency—and then they’ll buy meals and haircuts—it will stimulate the economy and eventually many people will get their own laptops.” But it would be even more efficient to buy 5,000 One Laptop Per Child laptops, thus providing employment to the OLPC manufacturers and giving out laptops directly.

I’ve touched before on the failure to look for third alternatives. But this is not really motivated stopping. Calling it “motivated stopping” would imply that there was a search carried out in the first place.

In “The Bottom Line,” I observed that only the real determinants of our beliefs can ever influence our real-world accuracy. Only the real determinants of our actions can influence our effectiveness in achieving our goals. Someone who buys a million-dollar laptop was really thinking, “Ooh, shiny,” and that was the one true causal history of their decision to buy a laptop. No amount of “justification” can change this, unless the justification is a genuine, newly running search process that can change the conclusion. Really change the conclusion. Most criticism carried out from a sense of duty is more of a token inspection than anything else. Free elections in a one-party country.

To genuinely justify the Bible as an object of laudation by reference to its literary quality, you would have to somehow perform a neutral reading through candidate books until you found the book of highest literary quality. Renown is one reasonable criterion for generating candidates, so I suppose you could legitimately end up reading Shakespeare, the Bible, and Gödel, Escher, Bach. (Otherwise it would be quite a coincidence to find the Bible as a candidate, among a million other books.) The real difficulty is in that “neutral reading” part. Easy enough if you’re not a Christian, but if you are . . .

But of course nothing like this happened. No search ever occurred. Writing the justification of “literary quality” above the bottom line of “I ♥ the Bible” is a historical misrepresentation of how the bottom line really got there, like selling cat milk as cow milk. That is just not where the bottom line really came from. That is just not what originally happened to produce that conclusion.

If you genuinely subject your conclusion to a criticism that can potentially de-conclude it—if the criticism genuinely has that power—then that does modify “the real algorithm behind” your conclusion. It changes the entanglement of your conclusion over possible worlds. But people overestimate, by far, how likely they really are to change their minds.

With all those open minds out there, you’d think there’d be more belief-updating.

Let me guess: Yes, you admit that you originally decided you wanted to buy a million-dollar laptop by thinking, “Ooh, shiny.” Yes, you concede that this isn’t a decision process consonant with your stated goals. But since then, you’ve decided that you really ought to spend your money in such fashion as to provide laptops to as many laptopless wretches as possible. And yet you just couldn’t find any more efficient way to do this than buying a million-dollar diamond-studded laptop—because, hey, you’re giving money to a laptop store and stimulating the economy! Can’t beat that!

My friend, I am damned suspicious of this amazing coincidence. I am damned suspicious that the best answer under this lovely, rational, altruistic criterion X, is also the idea that just happened to originally pop out of the unrelated indefensible process Y . If you don’t think that rolling dice would have been likely to produce the correct answer, then how likely is it to pop out of any other irrational cognition?

It’s improbable that you used mistaken reasoning, yet made no mistakes.
