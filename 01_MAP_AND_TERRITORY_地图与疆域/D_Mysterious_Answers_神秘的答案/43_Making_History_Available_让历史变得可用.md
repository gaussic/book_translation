## 让历史变得“可用”

有一种思维习惯，我称之为“从虚构证据中泛化”的逻辑谬误。比如，记者在报道人工智能时会提到《终结者》电影，他们并不是真的把《终结者》当作预言或铁律。但这部电影会被当作一个“可用”的案例，就好像记者在别的星球上亲眼见过类似事件，所以在地球上也可能发生。

与“从虚构证据泛化”相反的错误，是对历史证据反应不够强烈。泛化虚构证据的问题在于它是虚构——它从未真正发生过。它并不是从我们这个真实宇宙的分布中抽取的；虚构与现实有系统性的差异。而历史是真实发生过的，理应被“调取”出来。

在我们的祖先环境中，没有电影；你亲眼所见的就是真的。难怪那些逼真的影视画面会对我们产生过大的影响？反过来，真实发生过的事情，我们只是以纸上的墨迹遇见它们——它们确实发生过，但我们从未亲眼见证。我们不会记得它们发生在自己身上。

相反的错误，就是把历史当作“故事”来处理，用大脑中处理小说的那部分来加工。你嘴上说那是“事实”而不是“虚构”，但这并不意味着你真的被它打动到应有的程度。许多认知偏差都源于我们对干巴巴、抽象信息反应不够强烈。

当我终于意识到自己正站在谁的鞋子里——在给一个神秘问题一个神秘答案之后——我突然感受到与过去意外的联系。我意识到，活力论的提出与消亡——我以前只在书里读到过——其实真的发生在真实的人身上，他们的体验和我自己发明又推翻神秘答案时的体验几乎一样。我还意识到，如果我真的亲身经历过那些历史——如果我曾亲历科学革命，而不是只在历史书里读到——我大概不会再犯同样的错误。我不会再编造另一个神秘答案；头一千次教训早就把道理敲进脑子里了。

所以（我想），要真正感受到历史的力量，我应该试着模拟一个“亲历历史的 Eliezer”的思考方式——我应该努力让自己像真的经历过历史书里的一切那样去思考。<sup>1</sup> 我应该沉浸在历史中，想象自己生活在那些只在纸上见过的时代。

为什么我要记住莱特兄弟的首次飞行？我又不在现场。但作为理性主义者，既然那件事真的发生过，我敢不敢不去记住它？亲眼见证一件事（其实只是光子反射的因果链，并非直接连接）和通过历史书见证一件事，真的有那么大区别吗？光子和历史书都通过因果链追溯到事件本身。

我必须克服“只因出生在某个时代而失忆”的假性失忆。我必须回忆——让一切记忆都“可用”——而不仅仅是那些碰巧属于我和我所处时代的记忆。

地球突然变得更古老了。

在我原有的记忆中，美国一直都存在——从来没有没有美国的时代。我直到那时才想起，罗马帝国曾经崛起，带来和平与秩序，延续了许多个世纪，直到我都忘了世界曾经不是这样；但帝国终究覆灭，蛮族攻陷了我的城市，我曾拥有的知识也随之失落。现代世界在我眼中变得更加脆弱；它并不是第一个现代世界。

那么多错误，一次又一次地被重演，只因为我不记得自己曾经犯过这些错——在那些我未曾亲历的时代……

而你还会怀疑克服偏见是否重要吗？

你不记得你的偏见曾经杀死过你多少次吗？你不记得？我注意到，致命错误之后常常会伴随突然的失忆。但请相信我，这些事真的发生过。我记得，虽然我并不在场。

所以下次你怀疑未来会有多奇异时，请记住你曾出生在一万年前的狩猎采集部落，那时根本没人知道科学为何物。记住当科学解释了你曾无比敬畏的伟大神秘时，你内心深处的震撼。记住你曾相信吃对蘑菇就能飞翔，后来失望地接受自己永远无法飞翔，然后你真的飞了。记住你曾一直认为奴隶制理所当然，后来你改变了想法。不要想象你本可以预见这些变化，那是失忆。要记住，事实上你并没有猜到。记住，世纪复一世纪，世界总是以你未曾预料的方式改变。

也许这样，你就不会再对未来的变化感到那么震惊了。

## Making History Available

There is a habit of thought which I call the logical fallacy of generalization from fictional evidence. Journalists who, for example, talk about the Terminator movies in a report on AI, do not usually treat Terminator as a prophecy or fixed truth. But the movie is recalled—is available—as if it were an illustrative historical case. As if the journalist had seen it happen on some other planet, so that it might well happen here.

There is an inverse error to generalizing from fictional evidence: failing to be sufficiently moved by historical evidence. The trouble with generalizing from fictional evidence is that it is fiction—it never actually happened. It’s not drawn from the same distribution as this, our real universe; fiction differs from reality in systematic ways. But history has happened, and should be available.

In our ancestral environment, there were no movies; what you saw with your own eyes was true. Is it any wonder that fictions we see in lifelike moving pictures have too great an impact on us? Conversely, things that really happened, we encounter as ink on paper; they happened, but we never saw them happen. We don’t remember them happening to us.

The inverse error is to treat history as mere story, process it with the same part of your mind that handles the novels you read. You may say with your lips that it is “truth,” rather than “fiction,” but that doesn’t mean you are being moved as much as you should be. Many biases involve being insufficiently moved by dry, abstract information.

When I finally realized whose shoes I was standing in, after having given a Mysterious Answer to a mysterious question, there was a sudden shock of unexpected connection with the past. I realized that the invention and destruction of vitalism—which I had only read about in books—had actually happened to real people, who experienced it much the same way I experienced the invention and destruction of my own mysterious answer. And I also realized that if I had actually experienced the past—if I had lived through past scientific revolutions myself, rather than reading about them in history books—I probably would not have made the same mistake again. I would not have come up with another mysterious answer; the first thousand lessons would have hammered home the moral.

So (I thought), to feel sufficiently the force of history, I should try to approximate the thoughts of an Eliezer who had lived through history— I should try to think as if everything I read about in history books had actually happened to me.<sup>1</sup> I should immerse myself in history, imagine living through eras I only saw as ink on paper.

Why should I remember the Wright Brothers’ first flight? I was not there. But as a rationalist, could I dare to not remember, when the event actually happened? Is there so much difference between seeing an event through your eyes—which is actually a causal chain involving reflected photons, not a direct connection—and seeing an event through a history book? Photons and history books both descend by causal chains from the event itself.

I had to overcome the false amnesia of being born at a particular time. I had to recall—make available—all the memories, not just the memories which, by mere coincidence, belonged to myself and my own era.

The Earth became older, of a sudden.

To my former memory, the United States had always existed—there was never a time when there was no United States. I had not remembered, until that time, how the Roman Empire rose, and brought peace and order, and lasted through so many centuries, until I forgot that things had ever been otherwise; and yet the Empire fell, and barbarians overran my city, and the learning that I had possessed was lost. The modern world became more fragile to my eyes; it was not the first modern world.

So many mistakes, made over and over and over again, because I did not remember making them, in every era I never lived . . .

And to think, people sometimes wonder if overcoming bias is important.

Don’t you remember how many times your biases have killed you? You don’t? I’ve noticed that sudden amnesia often follows a fatal mistake. But take it from me, it happened. I remember; I wasn’t there.

So the next time you doubt the strangeness of the future, remember how you were born in a hunter-gatherer tribe ten thousand years ago, when no one knew of Science at all. Remember how you were shocked, to the depths of your being, when Science explained the great and terrible sacred mysteries that you once revered so highly. Remember how you once believed that you could fly by eating the right mushrooms, and then you accepted with disappointment that you would never fly, and then you flew. Remember how you had always thought that slavery was right and proper, and then you changed your mind. Don’t imagine how you could have predicted the change, for that is amnesia. Remember that, in fact, you did not guess. Remember how, century after century, the world changed in ways you did not guess.

Maybe then you will be less shocked by what happens next.
