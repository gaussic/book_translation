## 解释 / 崇拜 / 忽略？

当我们的部落在草原上游荡，寻找果树和猎物时，偶尔会有水从天而降。

“为什么有时候水会从天上落下来？”我问我们部落里那位留着胡子的智者。

他思索片刻，这个问题以前从未想过，然后说：“有时候，天上的精灵会打架，打架时，他们的血就会从天上滴下来。”

“天上的精灵从哪来的？”我又问。

他压低声音，低声说道：“来自很久很久以前，来自远古时代。”

当下雨时，如果你不知道原因，你有几种选择。第一，你可以干脆不去问为什么——不追问这个问题，或者根本就没想到要问。这就是“忽略”命令，正是那位胡子智者最初的选择。第二，你可以试着想出某种解释，也就是“解释”命令，就像智者在你第一次提问时那样。第三，你可以享受那种神秘莫测的感觉——这就是“崇拜”命令。

正如你从这个故事中会注意到的，每当你选择“解释”，最好的结果就是你得到一个解释，比如“天上的精灵”。但这个解释本身又会面临同样的困境——解释、崇拜还是忽略？每次你点击“解释”，科学就会运转一阵，给出一个解释，然后又弹出一个新的对话框。作为理性主义者，我们觉得有责任不断点击“解释”，但这似乎是一条没有尽头的路。

你为生命点击“解释”，得到化学；为化学点击“解释”，得到原子；为原子点击“解释”，得到电子和原子核；为原子核点击“解释”，得到量子色动力学和夸克；为夸克从何而来点击“解释”，又回到大爆炸……

我们可以为大爆炸点击“解释”，等待科学继续运转，也许有一天会给出一个完美的解释。但那时又会弹出一个新的对话框。所以，如果我们一直继续下去，最终必然会遇到一个特殊的对话框，一个新选项——“无需再解释的解释”，也就是链条的终点——也许，这才是唯一值得知道的解释。

这时——我刚刚点击了“崇拜”。

永远不要忘记，崇拜某物的方式远不止在祭坛上点蜡烛那么简单。

如果我说：“嗯，这确实看起来很悖论。我想知道这个表面上的悖论是怎么被解决的？”那我就是点击了“解释”，虽然有时候要等很久才能得到答案。

如果你觉得整个问题无关紧要、不重要，或者你宁愿把它留到明天再想，那你就是点击了“忽略”。

请明智地选择你的选项。

## Explain/Worship/Ignore?

As our tribe wanders through the grasslands, searching for fruit trees and prey, it happens every now and then that water pours down from the sky.

“Why does water sometimes fall from the sky?” I ask the bearded wise man of our tribe.

He thinks for a moment, this question having never occurred to him before, and then says, “From time to time, the sky spirits battle, and when they do, their blood drips from the sky.”

“Where do the sky spirits come from?” I ask.

His voice drops to a whisper. “From the before time. From the long long ago.”

When it rains, and you don’t know why, you have several options. First, you could simply not ask why—not follow up on the question, or never think of the question in the first place. This is the Ignore command, which the bearded wise man originally selected. Second, you could try to devise some sort of explanation, the Explain command, as the bearded man did in response to your first question. Third, you could enjoy the sensation of mysteriousness—the Worship command.

Now, as you are bound to notice from this story, each time you select Explain, the best-case scenario is that you get an explanation, such as “sky spirits.” But then this explanation itself is subject to the same dilemma—Explain, Worship, or Ignore? Each time you hit Explain, science grinds for a while, returns an explanation, and then another dialog box pops up. As good rationalists, we feel duty-bound to keep hitting Explain, but it seems like a road that has no end.

You hit Explain for life, and get chemistry; you hit Explain for chemistry, and get atoms; you hit Explain for atoms, and get electrons and nuclei; you hit Explain for nuclei, and get quantum chromodynamics and quarks; you hit Explain for how the quarks got there, and get back the Big Bang . . .

We can hit Explain for the Big Bang, and wait while science grinds through its process, and maybe someday it will return a perfectly good explanation. But then that will just bring up another dialog box. So, if we continue long enough, we must come to a special dialog box, a new option, an Explanation That Needs No Explanation, a place where the chain ends—and this, maybe, is the only explanation worth knowing.

There—I just hit Worship.

Never forget that there are many more ways to worship something than lighting candles around an altar.

If I’d said, “Huh, that does seem paradoxical. I wonder how the apparent paradox is resolved?” then I would have hit Explain, which does sometimes take a while to produce an answer.

And if the whole issue seems to you unimportant, or irrelevant, or if you’d rather put off thinking about it until tomorrow, than you have hit Ignore.

Select your option wisely.
