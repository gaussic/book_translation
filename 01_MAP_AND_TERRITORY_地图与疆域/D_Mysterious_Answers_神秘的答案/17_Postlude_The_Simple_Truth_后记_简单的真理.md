**后记：简单的真理**

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

> 我记得我写过一篇关于存在主义的论文。我的老师给我打了个F。她在论文中每次出现“真”或“真理”时，都划上了下划线，大概有二十次左右，并在每次旁边写了一个问号。她想知道我所说的“真理”是什么意思。

这篇文章的目的是恢复对“真理”的一种天真的看法。

有人对你说：“我的神奇蛇油可以在三周内治愈你的肺癌。”你回答：“不是有一项临床研究显示这个说法不成立吗？”对方回应：“你所说的‘真理’观念非常天真；你所谓的‘真’是什么意思？”

许多人在被这样质问时，不知道如何用精确的细节作出回答。然而，他们如果放弃“真理”这一概念，未必明智。曾经有一段时间，没人能精确地知道引力的方程式，但如果你从悬崖上走下去，你依然会掉下来。

我常常看到——特别是在互联网上的邮件列表中——在其他对话中，某人说“X是对的”，然后便引发了关于“对”这个词用法的争论。这篇文章并不是为了成为那个争论的百科全书式参考。相反，我希望争论者阅读这篇文章，然后回到他们在有人质疑“真理”的本质之前，所讨论的内容。

在这篇文章中，我提出了一些问题。如果你觉得有一个显而易见的答案，那可能正是我打算给出的答案。显而易见的选择并不总是最好的选择，但有时候，老天，这确实是最好的选择。当我找到一个显而易见的答案时，我并不会立刻停止思考，但如果我继续思考，显而易见的答案仍然显得显而易见，我也不觉得有什么负罪感。哦，当然，每个人都认为二加二等于四，每个人都说二加二等于四，而且在日常生活的平凡繁琐中，每个人都像是在说二加二等于四，但二加二到底等于多少呢？我尽力算了算，还是四。即使我用一种庄严、预示性的语气来问这个问题，它仍然是四。

这听起来是不是一个过于简单的答案？也许吧，或许在这次的情况下，生活不需要复杂。那不是很令人耳目一新吗？

如果你是那些幸运的人之一，开始时就觉得这个问题很微不足道，我希望它在结尾时依然显得微不足道。如果你在深刻且有意义的问题面前感到困惑，记住，如果你完全理解一个系统如何运作，并能自己用桶和石子搭建一个系统，那么它就不应该再是谜团。

如果当你将比喻理解为比喻时感到困惑，试着把一切都完全字面化地理解。

想象一下，在一个没有记录历史或正式数学的时代，我是一个牧羊人，常常遇到无法追踪羊群的问题。我的羊群晚上会睡在一个围栏里，围栏足够高，可以防止夜间出没的狼进入。每天，我都得把羊从围栏放出来，让它们吃草；晚上，我必须把羊找回来并把它们送回围栏。如果有羊留在外面，第二天早晨我会发现它的尸体，被狼杀死并吃了一半。但在我知道大多数羊应该都在围栏里的情况下，反复在田野里寻找最后一只羊，常常让我感到沮丧。有时我早早放弃了，通常也能侥幸逃过一劫；但大约每十次，有一次第二天早晨会发现一只死羊。

如果有某种方法可以知道羊是否还在吃草，而不必去麻烦地寻找该多好啊！我尝试了几种方法：我掷部落的占卜棒；我训练自己的超能力，通过千里眼来找羊；我小心寻找一些理由，认为所有羊都已经回到围栏。结果都没有用。每当我早早就去睡觉，大约每十次，有一次第二天早晨会发现死羊。也许我意识到我的方法不管用，也许我会为每次失败找借口；但我的困境依旧没有改变。我可以花一个小时去搜索每一个可能的角落，尽管大多数时候已经没有羊剩下；或者我可以早点睡觉，平均失去一只羊的代价。

某个下午，我感到格外疲惫。我掷了占卜棒，占卜棒显示所有羊都已经回来。我回想着每一个角落，没能想象到有羊在其中。尽管我还不够自信，我还是看了一眼围栏，似乎羊还不少。我回顾了一下之前的努力，认为自己做得特别仔细。这让我心中的焦虑减轻了，我便去睡觉。第二天早晨，我发现了两只死羊。我的内心被触动了，我开始创造性地思考。

那天，围栏门外传来沉重的敲打声。

第二天早晨，我只把围栏门打开了一点，当每只羊走出围栏时，我把一颗小石子扔进旁边门口钉着的桶里。下午，当每只羊返回时，我从桶里拿出一颗小石子。当桶里的石子用完时，我就可以停止搜索，安心睡觉。这是一个绝妙的主意，它将彻底改变牧羊工作。

那是理论。在实践中，这个方法经过了几次完善，才得以可靠地工作。几次我搜索了好几个小时，根本没有找到任何羊，第二天早晨也没有发现掉队的羊。在这些场合中，我需要深思熟虑才能找出我的石子桶系统出了什么问题。每次我回想起没有羊的搜索时，我才意识到我在开始时就已经往桶里放了石子；这个事实，证明这是个坏主意。还有一次，我在早晨和下午之间随便往桶里丢石子，只是为了消磨时间；这也是个坏主意，等我搜寻了几个小时才意识到这一点。但我不断练习我的石子工艺，最终成为了一个相当熟练的石子工匠。

某个下午，一位穿着华丽白袍、戴着月桂冠、穿着凉鞋并且配着西装的人沿着通往我牧场的沙土小道踱步而来。

“我能帮忙吗？”我问。

那人从外套里取出一枚徽章并打开，毫无疑问地证明了他是来自罗马参议院的代表——马克·索非斯提库斯·马克西穆斯。 （有人可能会怀疑其他人能否偷走这个徽章，但这些徽章的力量如此强大，以至于任何其他人若试图使用它，立刻会变成马克。）

“叫我马克就好。”他说，“我是来没收这些魔法石子的，代表参议院的名义；如此强大的神器不能落入无知的人手中。”

“那个该死的学徒。”我低声咕哝，“他又去和村民们唠嗑了。”然后我看着马克严肃的脸，叹了口气。“这些不是魔法石子。”我大声说，“只是我从地上捡的普通石子。”

马克脸上闪过一丝困惑，然后他又笑了。“我是来拿魔法桶的！”他说。

“这不是魔法桶。”我疲惫地说，“我以前用它放脏袜子。”

马克的脸上满是困惑。“那魔法在哪里？”他问。

一个有趣的问题。“难以解释。”我说。

我的学徒奥特雷，听到骚动走了过来，主动为我解释：“是桶里石子的水平。”奥特雷说，“有一个魔法的石子水平，你必须把水平调到正好，否则就不起作用。如果你往里扔更多石子，或者拿出一些，桶里的石子水平就不对了。现在，魔法水平是……”奥特雷低头看了看桶，“大约是三分之一。”

“我明白了！”马克兴奋地说。从他的后口袋里，马克拿出了自己的桶和一堆石子。然后他抓起几把石子，塞进了桶里。然后马克看着桶里的石子，数了数。“好了，”马克说，“这个桶的魔法水平是半满。这样可以吗？”

“不行！”奥特雷急促地说。“半满不是魔法水平。魔法水平大约是三分之一。半满肯定不魔法。而且，你用了错的桶。”

马克困惑地转向我。“我不是听你说过桶不是魔法的吗？”

“不是。”我说。一只羊从门口走出来，我把另一颗石子丢进了桶里。“而且，我在看羊。你去问奥特雷。”

马克怀疑地看着我扔进去的石子，但决定暂时搁置这个问题。然后他转向奥特雷，挺直了腰。“这是一个自由的国家，”马克说，“当然是在参议院仁慈的独裁统治下。我可以往任何我喜欢的桶里扔任何我喜欢的石子。”

奥特雷考虑了一下，最后说道：“不行，你不能这样做，没办法产生魔法。”

“看，”马克耐心地说，“我仔细观察过你。你看了看你的桶，检查了石子的水平，然后说那是魔法水平。我也做了一样的事。”

“这不是这样运作的。”奥特雷说。

“哦，我明白了，”马克说，“不是我桶里的石子水平是魔法的，而是你桶里的石子水平是魔法的。你是不是这么说的？你为什么认为你桶比我的桶更好呢？”

“嗯，”奥特雷说，“如果我们把你的桶里的石子倒空，然后把我桶里的所有石子倒进你的桶里，那么你的桶就会达到魔法水平。我们还可以用一种方法来检查你的桶是否达到魔法水平，前提是我们知道我的桶达到了魔法水平；我们称之为桶比较操作。”

---

又有一只羊走过，我又扔了一颗石子。

“他又扔了一颗石子！”马克说，“你是不是也声称新的石子水平也是魔法的？我可以往你的桶里丢石子，直到水平和我的一样，这样我们的桶就一致了。你不过是在用我的桶和你的桶比较，来判断是否认为石子水平是‘魔法’的罢了。嗯，我认为你的桶不是魔法的，因为它的石子水平和我的不一样。所以！”

“等一下，”奥特雷说，“你不明白——”

“你所谓的‘魔法水平’，其实就是你自己桶里石子的水平。而我所说的‘魔法水平’，就是我桶里的石子水平。所以你看着我的桶说它‘不是魔法的’，但是‘魔法’这个词对不同的人来说是不同的意思。你得指明这到底是哪一种魔法。你应该说，我的桶没有‘奥特雷的魔法水平’，而我则说你的桶没有‘马克的魔法水平’。这样，表面上的矛盾就消失了。”

“但是——”奥特雷无奈地说。

“不同的人可以有不同的桶，桶里的石子水平也不同，这证明了所谓的‘魔法’完全是随意和主观的。”

“马克，”我说，“有人告诉你这些石子到底有什么作用吗？”

“作用？”马克说，“我以为它们只是魔法罢了。”

“如果这些石子没有任何作用，”奥特雷说，“我们的ISO 9000流程效率审核员早就把这程序从我们日常工作中删掉了。”

“你们的审核员叫什么名字？”

“达尔文，”奥特雷说。

“嗯，”马克说，“查尔斯确实是个严格的审核员。那么这些石子会祝福羊群，导致羊群的增加吗？”

“不，”我说，“这些石子的作用是这样的：如果我们看桶，发现桶里没有石子了，我们就知道草场里也没有羊。如果我们不使用桶，我们必须一直搜索，直到天黑，怕有一只羊掉队。如果我们早早结束工作，那么有时候第二天早晨会发现一只死羊，因为狼会把留在外面的羊撕成碎片。如果我们看桶，我们就知道所有羊都回来了，这样我们可以安心地休息。”

马克考虑了一会儿。“这听起来有些不太可信，”他说，最终说道。“你考虑过用占卜棒吗？占卜棒是万无一失的，至少任何说它们会出错的人都会被活活烧死。这是一种极其痛苦的死法，所以占卜棒必须是极其可靠的。”

“你如果喜欢，可以用占卜棒。”我说。

“哦，天哪，当然不行，”马克说，“它们每次都无误地完美运作，正如这些神圣工具所应具备的那样。但是如果第二天早晨有死羊怎么办？我只在确信它们绝对不会出错时才使用占卜棒。否则我可能会被活活烧死。那么你的魔法桶是怎么运作的？”

魔法桶是怎么运作的……？我得从最简单的情况开始。“好吧，”我说，“假设草场是空的，而桶里却不空。那我们就会浪费几个小时寻找一只根本不存在的羊。如果草场里有羊，但桶是空的，那么奥特雷和我会过早休息，第二天早晨就会发现死羊。所以，空桶是魔法的，当且仅当草场里没有羊的时候——”

“等一下，”奥特雷说，“听起来像是个空洞的同义反复。空桶和空草场不是显然一样的吗？”

“这不是空洞的，”我说，“这儿有个类比：逻辑学家阿尔弗雷德·塔尔斯基曾说过，‘雪是白的’这个断言只有在雪确实是白的情况下才为真。如果你能理解这个，你就能明白为什么空桶是魔法的，只有在草场里没有羊的时候。”

“等一下，”马克说，“这些是桶。它们和羊一点关系都没有。桶和羊显然是完全不同的。羊怎么可能和桶互动呢？”

“那你认为魔法来自哪里？”奥特雷问。

马克思考了一下。“你说过可以通过比较两个桶来检查它们是否有相同的水平……我能明白桶和桶之间是怎么互动的。也许当你有一大堆桶，而它们的水平都一样时，这就是产生魔法的原因。我把它叫做魔法桶的连贯理论。”

“有意思，”奥特雷说，“我知道我的师父正在研究一个有多个桶的系统——他说它可能会因为‘冗余’和‘错误修正’的原因运作得更好。听起来像是连贯主义。”

“它们不完全一样——”我开始说。

“让我们测试一下魔法桶的连贯理论吧，”奥特雷说，“我知道你背口袋里还有五个桶。我把我们正在用的桶交给你，然后你可以把其他桶装到相同的水平——”

马克吓得退了两步。“停！这些桶是我家族传下来的，它们一直保持同样的水平！如果我接受你的桶，我的桶就会失去连贯性，魔法就会消失！”

“但你现在的桶和羊根本没有关系！”奥特雷抗议道。

马克看起来非常恼火。“听着，我之前已经解释过了，显然没有任何方式能让羊与桶发生互动。桶只能与其他桶互动。”

“每当羊经过，我就丢一个小石子。”我指出。

“羊经过时，你丢一个石子？”马克说，“那和什么有关系？”

“这是羊和石子之间的互动。”我回答。

“不，是石子和你之间的互动。”马克说，“魔法并不是来自羊，而是来自你。普通的羊显然没有魔力。魔法必须来自某个地方，经过某个过程，才到达桶。”

我指着栅门上方的一个木制装置。“你看到那个从木架上垂下来的布条了吗？我们还在研究它——它并不总是可靠——但当羊经过时，它会碰到布条。当布条被拨开时，一颗石子就会从储水池掉落到桶里。这样，奥特雷和我就不用亲自丢石子了。”

马克皱起了眉头。“我有点跟不上你的思路……那块布是魔法的吗？”

我耸耸肩。“我从一家叫‘自然选择’的公司网上订购的。那种布料叫做‘感官模式’。”我停了下来，看到马克和奥特雷不可置信的表情。“我承认名字有点像新纪元的东西。重点是，羊经过时会触发一个因果链，最终导致一颗石子掉进桶里。然后你就可以把这个桶与其他桶进行比较，依此类推。”

“我还是不明白。”马克说，“你不可能把羊放进桶里。桶里只能放石子，而显然石子只能与其他石子互动。”

“羊与那些与石子互动的东西发生互动……”我搜索着类比。“假设你低头看着你的鞋带。一颗光子从太阳出发；然后穿过地球的大气层；接着反射到你的鞋带上；然后通过你的眼睛的瞳孔；再到达视网膜；最后被杆状或圆锥状细胞吸收。光子的能量让连接的神经元发火，这导致其他神经元的激活。你大脑的视觉皮层中形成的神经激活模式会与你关于鞋带的信念互动，因为鞋带的信念也存在于神经基础中。如果你能理解这一点，你就应该能明白，羊的经过是如何导致石子掉进桶里的。”

“在这个过程中，到底是哪个点让石子变得魔法呢？”马克问。

“它……呃……”现在我开始有点困惑了。我摇了摇头，想清理一下脑袋。今天早上醒来时，这一切看起来是如此简单，而石子和桶的系统到现在也没有变得更加复杂。“如果你记住系统的目的是为了追踪羊，理解起来会容易一些。”

马克叹了口气。“算了……显然你不懂。也许所有石子从一开始就是有魔力的，甚至在它们进入桶之前。我们可以称这种观点为‘泛石子主义’。”

“哈！”奥特雷说，语气中充满了蔑视，“纯粹是空想！不是所有石子都是一样的。你桶里的石子没有魔力。它们只是石块！”

马克的脸色变得严肃。“现在，”他大声说，“现在你看到了你走的道路的危险！一旦你说某些人的石子是魔法的，某些人的不是，你的骄傲就会吞噬你！你会觉得自己比所有人都优越，然后就堕落！历史上许多人曾经因认为自己的石子最为强大而进行折磨和谋杀！”马克的语气中带着轻蔑，“崇拜某种石子水平作为‘魔法’意味着你相信存在一个‘至高无上的桶’。如今没人再相信‘至高无上的桶’。”

“第一，”我说，“羊不是绝对的石子。第二，我不认为我的桶里实际装着羊。第三，我并不崇拜我的桶水平是完美的——我有时会调整它——我这么做是因为我关心羊。”

“此外，”奥特雷说，“如果有人认为拥有绝对的石子就可以进行折磨和谋杀，那么他们犯了一个错误，这和桶没有关系。你在解决错误的问题。”

马克冷静下来。“我想我不能期望从普通的牧羊人那里得到更好的理解。你们大概认为雪是白的，对吧？”

“嗯……是的？”奥特雷说。

“你不觉得乔治·斯大林认为雪是白的这件事很让人困扰吗？”

“嗯……不？”奥特雷说。

马克惊讶地盯着奥特雷，最后耸耸肩。“假设——纯粹是为了辩论的目的——你的石子是有魔力的，而我的不是。你能告诉我区别在哪里吗？”

“我的石子代表羊！”奥特雷得意地说，“你的石子没有代表性属性，所以它们无法工作。它们是没有意义的。看看它们，毫无语义内容；它们只是石子！你需要一个具有特殊因果力的桶。”

“啊！”马克说，“特殊的因果力，而不是魔法。”

“没错。”奥特雷说，“我不是迷信。在当今时代，假设魔法是不可接受的，尤其是对于国际牧羊界来说。我们发现假设魔法根本不能解释牧羊现象。所以当我遇到不理解的事物时，如果我想用一个没有内在细节且即使回溯也无法做出预测的模型来解释，我就假设有特殊的因果力。或者我会称之为一种‘涌现现象’，之类的。”

“桶有什么特殊的因果力？”马克问。

“嗯……”奥特雷说，“也许这个桶具有与牧场的‘关联性’关系。这可以解释它为何能工作——当桶是空的时，就意味着牧场也是空的。”

“你在哪儿找到这个桶的？”马克问，“你怎么意识到它与牧场有‘关联性’？”

“这是一个普通的桶，”我说，“我以前用它爬树……我觉得这个问题不需要那么复杂。”

“我在和奥特雷说话。”马克说。

“你必须通过一种魔法仪式——抱歉，我是说一种具有特殊因果力的涌现过程——把桶和牧场，以及石子和羊绑定起来，这是我师傅发现的。”奥特雷解释道。

奥特雷随后试图描述这个仪式，马克在一旁点头，似乎完全理解。

“每次羊从门口出去，你都得往桶里扔一颗小石子？”马克问道。“每次羊回来时，你就得从桶里拿出一颗石子？”

奥特雷点点头。“对。”

“那一定很难，”马克同情地说。

奥特雷露出笑容，像雨水一样吸收着马克的同情。“完全正确！”奥特雷说。“这对情感的冲击极大。当桶里的石子水平保持了一段时间，你……你会渐渐对这个水平产生依赖。”

这时，一只羊走过门口，奥特雷看到后弯腰捡起一颗小石子，举到空中。“看！”奥特雷宣布。“一只羊走了！现在我要把这颗小石子扔进这个亲爱的桶里，打破这保持已久的水平——”又有一只羊走过。奥特雷正陷入自己的表演，错过了它，于是我把一颗石子丢进桶里。奥特雷依然在说：“——因为这正是牧羊人的终极考验，把石子扔进去，不管它多么痛苦，无论旧水平多么珍贵。事实上，只有最优秀的牧羊人才能应对如此严苛的要求——”

“奥特雷，”我说，“如果你想成为一名伟大的牧羊人，学会闭嘴，扔石子。没有废话，没有戏剧性。就做吧。”

“这个仪式，”马克说，“它通过同情与传染的神秘法则，将石子与羊绑定，就像巫术娃娃一样。”

奥特雷皱了皱眉，四处张望。“拜托！不要把它称作‘同情与传染’。我们牧羊人可是反对迷信的。用‘意图性’这个词，或者类似的词。”

“我可以看看那颗石子吗？”马克问。

“当然，”我说。我从桶里拿出一颗石子，扔给马克。然后我又低头捡起一颗石子，丢回桶里。

奥特雷看着我，迷惑不解。“你刚才不是弄错了吗？”

我耸耸肩。“我不这么认为。如果我弄错了，明天早上会有死羊，或者我们找几个小时也找不到羊。”

“但是——”奥特雷说。

“我教了你所有你知道的，但我没有教你我知道的一切，”我说。

马克正在认真查看那颗石子，专注地盯着它。“所以……那颗石子现在又有意图性了吗？”

“是的，”我说。“别再往你的手上加石子，或者扔掉手里的石子，不然你会破坏这个仪式。”

马克庄重地点点头。然后他继续检查那颗石子。“我现在明白了，为什么你的羊群如此庞大，”马克说。“有了这个桶的力量，你可以不断扔石子，而羊就会从田里回来。你可以从几只羊开始，让它们离开，然后在它们回来之前把桶填满。如果照顾这么多羊让你感到乏味，你可以让它们全都离开，然后从桶里几乎清空所有的石子，剩下的羊就会少一些……到剪毛的时候再增加羊群……天哪，伙计！你意识到你发现的这个仪式有多么强大了吗？我只能想象它的影响；人类可能会跨越一个十年——不，一百年！”

“不是那样的，”我说。“如果你在羊没有离开时加了石子，或者羊没有回来时拿走石子，那就破坏了仪式。力量不会在石子里停留，而是会一下子消失，就像肥皂泡破裂一样。”

马克的脸上写满了失望。“你确定吗？”

我点点头。“我试过了，结果没有成功。”

马克重重地叹了口气。“这个……数学，直到那时看起来还那么强大有用……哦，好吧。人类的进步就到此为止了。”

“马克，这个主意很棒，”奥特雷鼓励地说。“这个想法我没想到，但它太明显了……它本可以节省大量的努力……一定有办法挽救你的计划！我们可以尝试不同的桶，找找能保持石子里的魔力——呃，意图性——的桶，即使没有仪式。或者试试其他的石子。也许我们的石子本身没有能够固有意图性的属性。要不试试用刻成小羊形状的石头？或者直接在石子上写‘羊’字，或许也够了。”

“不会成功的，”我干巴巴地预测。

奥特雷继续说道：“也许我们需要有机石子，而不是硅石子……或者我们应该用昂贵的宝石。宝石的价格每十八个月翻一番，所以你现在可以买一些便宜的宝石，等着，二十年后它们就变得非常昂贵了。”

“你试过加石子来增加羊群吗？它没有成功？”马克问我。“你到底做了什么？”

“我拿了一把美元钞票。然后我把这些美元一张一张地藏在我的毯子下；每次藏一张钞票，我就从盒子里拿出一根回形针，堆成一个小堆。我小心不让自己在脑袋里算清楚，所以我只知道‘有很多’钞票和‘有很多’回形针。然后当所有的钞票都藏在毯子下后，我又加了一根回形针到堆里，就相当于往桶里扔了一颗多余的石子。然后我开始把钞票从毯子下拿出来，把回形针放回盒子里。直到最后，剩下的只有一根回形针。”

“那结果是什么意思？”奥特雷问。

“意味着这个把戏没成功。只要我在某一时刻破坏了仪式，力量就立刻消失了；回形针堆和钞票堆不再同时消失。”

“你真的试过这个？”马克问。

“是的，”我说，“我真的做了这个实验，以验证结果是否符合我的理论预测。我对科学方法有一种情感上的依赖，尽管有时它看起来荒谬。再说了，万一我错了呢？”

“如果它成功了，”马克说，“你就犯了伪造罪！想象一下，如果每个人都这么做；经济就会崩溃！每个人都会有数十亿的货币，但什么都买不到！”

“根本不是这样，”我回答。“按照那种逻辑，往回形针堆里加一根回形针就能创造出一张钞票，那么创造一张钞票就能创造出等值的商品和服务。”

马克摇摇头。“伪造依然是犯罪……你不应该尝试。”

“我很有信心我会失败。”

“啊！”马克说，“你预料到会失败！你不相信自己能做成！”

“的确，”我承认，“你准确地猜到了我的预期。”

“这就是问题所在，”马克利索地说。“魔法是由信念和意志力驱动的。如果你不相信自己能做到，就做不到。我们必须改变你对实验结果的信念，才能改变结果本身。”

“有趣，”我怀旧地说，“当我告诉奥特雷关于石子和桶的方法时，他也是这么说的。觉得太荒谬，不相信它能行得通，所以对他来说不起作用。”

“你是怎么说服他的？”马克问。

“我告诉他闭嘴，照着做，”我说，“当方法成功后，奥特雷开始相信它了。”

马克皱起眉头，困惑地说：“这没有道理。它并没有解决鸡和蛋的本质困境。”

“当然有道理。”奥特雷插话道，“桶法有效，不管你信不信。”

“这太荒谬了！”马克气愤地说，“我不信有什么魔法，不管信不信都能有效！”

“我也这么说过，”奥特雷插了一句，“显然我错了。”

马克专心地皱起脸。“但是……如果你不信那种不管信不信都能有效的魔法，那为什么当你不信时，桶法还能有效？你是不是信了那种不管信不信都能有效的魔法，而你自己并不知道？”

“我……不太觉得是……”奥特雷疑惑地说。

“那如果你不信那种不管信不信……等等，我需要用纸和笔理清楚这个问题——”马克开始疯狂地乱写，怀疑地看着结果，然后把纸翻过来，再也放弃了。“算了，”马克说，“魔法对我来说已经够难理解的了；元魔法我实在搞不清楚。”

“马克，我觉得你还不懂桶艺的艺术，”我说。“它不是用小石子控制羊群，而是让羊群控制小石子。在这个艺术里，不必一开始就相信它能有效。相反，首先是艺术有效了，然后你才会相信它有效。”

“或者说你信，”马克说。

“我信，”我答道，“因为这恰好是一个事实。现实与我的信念之间的相符，是因为现实控制了我的信念，而不是反过来。”

又有一只羊经过，我随手丢进了一颗小石子。

“啊！现在我们终于找到了问题的根源，”马克说。“这个所谓的‘现实’是怎么回事？我明白假设要优雅、可证伪或与证据相符的意思。但对我来说，说一个信念是‘真实的’或‘实际的’，不过是说你信某件事，和说你真的、真的信某件事之间的区别。”

我停了一下。“嗯……”我慢慢说，“坦白说，我自己也不完全清楚这个‘现实’是怎么回事。我不能在实验室里创造自己的现实，所以我可能还不理解它。但偶尔我会强烈相信某件事会发生，结果却发生了别的事情。我需要给这种决定实验结果的东西起个名字，所以我叫它‘现实’。这个‘现实’ somehow与我的最好的假设是分开的。即使我有一个简单的假设，并且这个假设得到了我所知道的所有证据的强烈支持， 有时我还是会感到惊讶。所以我需要不同的名字来区分那些决定我的预测的东西和那些决定我实验结果的东西。我把前者叫做‘信念’，把后者叫做‘现实’。”

马克哼了一声。“我都不知道为什么要听这些显而易见的废话。无论你说这个所谓的‘现实’怎么样，它也不过是另一种信念。即使你相信现实先于你的信念，实际上那也是一种信念。由此逻辑必然得出：现实并不存在，只有信念存在。”

“等一下，”奥特雷说，“你能重复一下最后那部分吗？中间突然转弯让我有点跟不上。”

“无论你怎么说现实，它不过是另一种信念，”马克解释道。“必然的结论是，现实并不存在，只有信念。”

“我明白了，”我说，“就像无论你吃什么，你都必须用嘴吃。由此推理，食物并不存在，只有嘴。”

“完全正确，”马克说。“你吃的所有东西都必须在嘴里。怎么可能有食物存在于你的嘴外呢？这个想法简直是荒谬的，证明了‘食物’是一个不连贯的概念。这就是为什么我们都在饿死——因为没有食物。”

奥特雷看了看自己的肚子。“但我并没有饿死。”

“啊哈！”马克得意地大叫，“那你是怎么说出这个反对意见的？用你的嘴巴，我的朋友！用你的嘴巴！还有什么比这更好的证明，证明了根本没有食物？”

“什么是饥饿？”一声尖锐、沙哑的声音从我们背后传来。奥特雷和我保持冷静，因为我们经历过这种场面。马克被吓得跳了起来，差点魂飞魄散。

达尔文检查员紧绷着嘴角，得意地看着自己制造的惊吓，随后在记事本上轻轻做了一个记号。

“只是一种比喻！”马克赶紧说，“你不需要拿走我的嘴巴，什么都不用——”

“如果没有食物，你为什么还需要嘴巴？”达尔文愤怒地问。“算了，我没有时间听这些胡话。我是来检查羊群的。”

“羊群很好，先生，”我说，“自从一月以来没有死羊。”

“很好，我给你0.12单位的健全度。那这个人来这里做什么？他是必需的部分吗？”

“据我看来，如果把他挂在热气球上作为配重，对人类种群会更有帮助，”我说。

“哎呦，”奥特雷温和地说道。

“我不关心人类种群。让他自己发声。”

马克高高昂起头，神气十足地说：“这个普通的牧羊人，”他指着我说，“宣称有现实存在。这个说法冒犯了我，因为我深信不疑，没有所谓的真理。‘真理’这一概念不过是某些人用来将他们自己的信仰强加给他人的一种策略。每种文化都有不同的‘真理’，而没有任何一种文化的‘真理’比其他的更优越。我说的这一切，始终适用于任何时间任何地点，我坚信你们必须同意。”

“等一下，”奥特雷说，“如果没有什么是真实的，那你为什么要让我相信你说的‘没有什么是真实的’？”

“我并没有说没有什么是真实的——”马克说。

“是的，你说了，”奥特雷插嘴道，“我听见了。”

“——我说的是，‘真理’是一些文化用来强迫他人接受他们信仰的借口。所以当你说某件事是‘真实的’，你其实只是说让你们的社群相信这件事会对你们有利。”

“那么你说的这句话，”我问，“它是真的吗？”

“绝对，完全是真的！”马克强调道，“人们创造自己的现实。”

“等等，”奥特雷再次感到困惑，“说人们创造自己的现实，逻辑上是一个完全不同的问题，和说没有真理这一点不能相提并论。后者的状态我根本无法想象清楚，可能是因为你仍然没有解释清楚它到底是怎么运作的——”

“你又来了，”马克有些恼火地说，“试图用你们西方的逻辑、理性、推理、一致性和自洽来分析。”

“太棒了，”奥特雷低声嘀咕，“现在我得再加一个第三个主题标题，来跟踪这个完全独立而不同的主张——”

“这不是独立的，”马克说，“看，你们的态度错了，试图把我的话当作假设，认真推导它们的结果。你们应该把它们看作完全通用的借口，我在别人说出我不喜欢的话时就会用它。它不是一个宇宙运作的模型，更像是一张免死金牌。关键是有选择性地使用这个借口。当我说‘没有真理’时，这只适用于你们说的魔法桶无论信不信都有效的那个说法。它不适用于我说的‘没有真理’。”

“嗯……为什么不呢？”奥特雷问道。

马克耐心地叹了口气。“奥特雷，你以为你是第一个提出这个问题的人吗？问我们，如果所有信仰都是没有意义的，那我们的信仰怎么可能有意义？这是许多学生在遇到这种哲学时说的话。顺便告诉你，这种哲学有很多追随者和广泛的文献。”

“那答案是什么？”奥特雷问。

“我们称它为‘反身性问题’，”马克解释道。

“但答案是什么？”奥特雷依然坚持。

马克以一种居高临下的微笑回应。“相信我，奥特雷，你不是第一个想出这个简单问题的人。你把它当作一个胜利的反驳提出来，实在没什么意义。”

“但真正的答案是什么？”

“好吧，我现在想谈谈逻辑是怎么杀死可爱的小海豹的——”

“你在浪费时间。”达尔文检查员厉声打断。

“更别提，丢失了羊群。”我说，同时丢进了一颗小石子。

达尔文检查员看着这两位争论者，他们显然都不愿放弃自己的立场。“听着，”达尔文语气变得温和，“我有一个简单的想法来解决你们的争执。你们说，”他指着马克，“人们的信仰改变了他们个人的现实。你热切地相信，”他的手指转向奥特雷，“马克的信仰无法改变现实。那么，让马克坚信他能飞，然后跳下悬崖。马克将会看到自己像鸟一样飞走，而奥特雷会看到他扑通一声掉下去摔成一团，你们两个都会很高兴。”

我们都停顿了，思考了一下。

“听起来挺有道理……”马克终于说道。

“那里有个悬崖。”达尔文检查员观察道。

奥特雷露出一副高度专注的表情。终于，他大声喊道：“等一下！如果真是这样的话，我们早就各自进入了自己的私人宇宙，在这种情况下，其他人只是你想象出来的幻象——那就没有必要再试图向我们证明什么了——”

从附近的悬崖上传来一声渐渐消失的尖叫，接着是沉闷孤独的摔落声。达尔文检查员翻动着记事本，翻到当前基因库那一页，用铅笔把马克的基因频率稍微调低了一些。

奥特雷看起来有些恶心。“那真的是必要的吗？”

“必要？”达尔文检查员困惑地问，“它就发生了……我不太明白你的问题。”

奥特雷和我转回到我们的桶那儿。是时候召唤羊群了。否则，这一切又有什么意义呢？

## Postlude: The Simple Truth

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

> I remember this paper I wrote on existentialism. My teacher gave it back with an F. She’d underlined true and truth wherever it appeared in the essay, probably about twenty times, with a question mark beside each. She wanted to know what I meant by truth.

This essay is meant to restore a naive view of truth.

Someone says to you: “My miracle snake oil can rid you of lung cancer in just three weeks.” You reply: “Didn’t a clinical study show this claim to be untrue?” The one returns: “This notion of ‘truth’ is quite naive; what do you mean by ‘true’?”

Many people, so questioned, don’t know how to answer in exquisitely rigorous detail. Nonetheless they would not be wise to abandon the concept of “truth.” There was a time when no one knew the equations of gravity in exquisitely rigorous detail, yet if you walked off a cliff, you would fall.

Often I have seen—especially on Internet mailing lists—that amidst other conversation, someone says “X is true,” and then an argument breaks out over the use of the word “true.” This essay is not meant as an encyclopedic reference for that argument. Rather, I hope the arguers will read this essay, and then go back to whatever they were discussing before someone questioned the nature of truth.

In this essay I pose questions. If you see what seems like a really obvious answer, it’s probably the answer I intend. The obvious choice isn’t always the best choice, but sometimes, by golly, it is. I don’t stop looking as soon I find an obvious answer, but if I go on looking, and the obvious-seeming answer still seems obvious, I don’t feel guilty about keeping it. Oh, sure, everyone thinks two plus two is four, everyone says two plus two is four, and in the mere mundane drudgery of everyday life everyone behaves as if two plus two is four, but what does two plus two really, ultimately equal? As near as I can figure, four. It’s still four even if I intone the question in a solemn, portentous tone of voice.

Does that seem like an unduly simple answer? Maybe, on this occasion, life doesn’t need to be complicated. Wouldn’t that be refreshing?

If you are one of those fortunate folk to whom the question seems trivial at the outset, I hope it still seems trivial at the finish. If you find yourself stumped by deep and meaningful questions, remember that if you know exactly how a system works, and could build one yourself out of buckets and pebbles, it should not be a mystery to you.

If confusion threatens when you interpret a metaphor as a metaphor, try taking everything completely literally.

Imagine that in an era before recorded history or formal mathematics, I am a shepherd and I have trouble tracking my sheep. My sheep sleep in an enclosure, a fold; and the enclosure is high enough to guard my sheep from wolves that roam by night. Each day I must release my sheep from the fold to pasture and graze; each night I must find my sheep and return them to the fold. If a sheep is left outside, I will find its body the next morning, killed and half-eaten by wolves. But it is so discouraging, to scour the fields for hours, looking for one last sheep, when I know that probably all the sheep are in the fold. Sometimes I give up early, and usually I get away with it; but around a tenth of the time there is a dead sheep the next morning.

If only there were some way to divine whether sheep are still grazing, without the inconvenience of looking! I try several methods: I toss the divination sticks of my tribe; I train my psychic powers to locate sheep through clairvoyance; I search carefully for reasons to believe all the sheep are in the fold. It makes no difference. Around a tenth of the times I turn in early, I find a dead sheep the next morning. Perhaps I realize that my methods aren’t working, and perhaps I carefully excuse each failure; but my dilemma is still the same. I can spend an hour searching every possible nook and cranny, when most of the time there are no remaining sheep; or I can go to sleep early and lose, on the average, one-tenth of a sheep.

Late one afternoon I feel especially tired. I toss the divination sticks and the divination sticks say that all the sheep have returned. I visualize each nook and cranny, and I don’t imagine scrying any sheep. I’m still not confident enough, so I look inside the fold and it seems like there are a lot of sheep, and I review my earlier efforts and decide that I was especially diligent. This dissipates my anxiety, and I go to sleep. The next morning I discover two dead sheep. Something inside me snaps, and I begin thinking creatively.

That day, loud hammering noises come from the gate of the sheepfold’s enclosure.

The next morning, I open the gate of the enclosure only a little way, and as each sheep passes out of the enclosure, I drop a pebble into a bucket nailed up next to the door. In the afternoon, as each returning sheep passes by, I take one pebble out of the bucket. When there are no pebbles left in the bucket, I can stop searching and turn in for the night. It is a brilliant notion. It will revolutionize shepherding.

That was the theory. In practice, it took considerable refinement before the method worked reliably. Several times I searched for hours and didn’t find any sheep, and the next morning there were no stragglers. On each of these occasions it required deep thought to figure out where my bucket system had failed. On returning from one fruitless search, I thought back and realized that the bucket already contained pebbles when I started; this, it turned out, was a bad idea. Another time I randomly tossed pebbles into the bucket, to amuse myself, between the morning and the afternoon; this too was a bad idea, as I realized after searching for a few hours. But I practiced my pebblecraft, and became a reasonably proficient pebblecrafter.

One afternoon, a man richly attired in white robes, leafy laurels, sandals, and business suit trudges in along the sandy trail that leads to my pastures.

“Can I help you?” I inquire.

The man takes a badge from his coat and flips it open, proving beyond the shadow of a doubt that he is Markos Sophisticus Maximus, a delegate from the Senate of Rum. (One might wonder whether another could steal the badge; but so great is the power of these badges that if any other were to use them, they would in that instant be transformed into Markos.)

“Call me Mark,” he says. “I’m here to confiscate the magic pebbles, in the name of the Senate; artifacts of such great power must not fall into ignorant hands.”

“That bleedin’ apprentice,” I grouse under my breath, “he’s been yakkin’ to the villagers again.” Then I look at Mark’s stern face, and sigh. “They aren’t magic pebbles,” I say aloud. “Just ordinary stones I picked up from the ground.”

A flicker of confusion crosses Mark’s face, then he brightens again. “I’m here for the magic bucket!” he declares.

“It’s not a magic bucket,” I say wearily. “I used to keep dirty socks in it.”

Mark’s face is puzzled. “Then where is the magic?” he demands.

An interesting question. “It’s hard to explain,” I say.

My current apprentice, Autrey, attracted by the commotion, wanders over and volunteers his explanation: “It’s the level of pebbles in the bucket,” Autrey says. “There’s a magic level of pebbles, and you have to get the level just right, or it doesn’t work. If you throw in more pebbles, or take some out, the bucket won’t be at the magic level anymore. Right now, the magic level is,” Autrey peers into the bucket, “about one-third full.”

“I see!” Mark says excitedly. From his back pocket Mark takes out his own bucket, and a heap of pebbles. Then he grabs a few handfuls of pebbles, and stuffs them into the bucket. Then Mark looks into the bucket, noting how many pebbles are there. “There we go,” Mark says, “the magic level of this bucket is half full. Like that?”

“No!” Autrey says sharply. “Half full is not the magic level. The magic level is about one-third. Half full is definitely unmagic. Furthermore, you’re using the wrong bucket.”

Mark turns to me, puzzled. “I thought you said the bucket wasn’t magic?”

“It’s not,” I say. A sheep passes out through the gate, and I toss another pebble into the bucket. “Besides, I’m watching the sheep. Talk to Autrey.”

Mark dubiously eyes the pebble I tossed in, but decides to temporarily shelve the question. Mark turns to Autrey and draws himself up haughtily. “It’s a free country,” Mark says, “under the benevolent dictatorship of the Senate, of course. I can drop whichever pebbles I like into whatever bucket I like.”

Autrey considers this. “No you can’t,” he says finally, “there won’t be any magic.”

“Look,” says Mark patiently, “I watched you carefully. You looked in your bucket, checked the level of pebbles, and called that the magic level. I did exactly the same thing.”

“That’s not how it works,” says Autrey.

“Oh, I see,” says Mark, “It’s not the level of pebbles in my bucket that’s magic, it’s the level of pebbles in your bucket. Is that what you claim? What makes your bucket so much better than mine, huh?”

“Well,” says Autrey, “if we were to empty your bucket, and then pour all the pebbles from my bucket into your bucket, then your bucket would have the magic level. There’s also a procedure we can use to check if your bucket has the magic level, if we know that my bucket has the magic level; we call that a bucket compare operation.”

Another sheep passes, and I toss in another pebble.

“He just tossed in another pebble!” Mark says. “And I suppose you claim the new level is also magic? I could toss pebbles into your bucket until the level was the same as mine, and then our buckets would agree. You’re just comparing my bucket to your bucket to determine whether you think the level is ‘magic’ or not. Well, I think your bucket isn’t magic, because it doesn’t have the same level of pebbles as mine. So there!”

“Wait,” says Autrey, “you don’t understand—”

“By ‘magic level,’ you mean simply the level of pebbles in your own bucket. And when I say ‘magic level,’ I mean the level of pebbles in my bucket. Thus you look at my bucket and say it ‘isn’t magic,’ but the word ‘magic’ means different things to different people. You need to specify whose magic it is. You should say that my bucket doesn’t have ‘Autrey’s magic level,’ and I say that your bucket doesn’t have ‘Mark’s magic level.’ That way, the apparent contradiction goes away.”

“But—” says Autrey helplessly.

“Different people can have different buckets with different levels of pebbles, which proves this business about ‘magic’ is completely arbitrary and subjective.”

“Mark,” I say, “did anyone tell you what these pebbles do?”

“Do?” says Mark. “I thought they were just magic.”

“If the pebbles didn’t do anything,” says Autrey, “our ISO 9000 process efficiency auditor would eliminate the procedure from our daily work.”

“What’s your auditor’s name?”

“Darwin,” says Autrey.

“Hm,” says Mark. “Charles does have a reputation as a strict auditor. So do the pebbles bless the flocks, and cause the increase of sheep?”

“No,” I say. “The virtue of the pebbles is this; if we look into the bucket and see the bucket is empty of pebbles, we know the pastures are likewise empty of sheep. If we do not use the bucket, we must search and search until dark, lest one last sheep remain. Or if we stop our work early, then sometimes the next morning we find a dead sheep, for the wolves savage any sheep left outside. If we look in the bucket, we know when all the sheep are home, and we can retire without fear.”

Mark considers this. “That sounds rather implausible,” he says eventually. “Did you consider using divination sticks? Divination sticks are infallible, or at least, anyone who says they are fallible is burned at the stake. This is an extremely painful way to die, so the divination sticks must be extremely infallible.”

“You’re welcome to use divination sticks if you like,” I say.

“Oh, good heavens, of course not,” says Mark. “They work infallibly, with absolute perfection on every occasion, as befits such blessed instruments. But what if there were a dead sheep the next morning? I only use the divination sticks when there is no possibility of their being proven wrong. Otherwise I might be burned alive. So how does your magic bucket work?”

How does the bucket work . . . ? I’d better start with the simplest possible case. “Well,” I say, “suppose the pastures are empty, and the bucket isn’t empty. Then we’ll waste hours looking for a sheep that isn’t there. And if there are sheep in the pastures, but the bucket is empty, then Autrey and I will turn in too early, and we’ll find dead sheep the next morning. So an empty bucket is magical if and only if the pastures are empty—”

“Hold on,” says Autrey. “That sounds like a vacuous tautology to me. Aren’t an empty bucket and empty pastures obviously the same thing?”

“It’s not vacuous,” I say. “Here’s an analogy: The logician Alfred Tarski once said that the assertion ‘Snow is white’ is true if and only if snow is white. If you can understand that, you should be able to see why an empty bucket is magical if and only if the pastures are empty of sheep.”

“Hold on,” says Mark. “These are buckets. They don’t have anything to do with sheep. Buckets and sheep are obviously completely different. There’s no way the sheep can ever interact with the bucket.”

“Then where do you think the magic comes from?” inquires Autrey.

Mark considers. “You said you could compare two buckets to check if they had the same level . . . I can see how buckets can interact with buckets. Maybe when you get a large collection of buckets, and they all have the same level, that’s what generates the magic. I’ll call that the coherentist theory of magic buckets.”

“Interesting,” says Autrey. “I know that my master is working on a system with multiple buckets—he says it might work better because of ‘redundancy’ and ‘error correction.’ That sounds like coherentism to me.”

“They’re not quite the same—” I start to say.

“Let’s test the coherentism theory of magic,” says Autrey. “I can see you’ve got five more buckets in your back pocket. I’ll hand you the bucket we’re using, and then you can fill up your other buckets to the same level—”

Mark recoils in horror. “Stop! These buckets have been passed down in my family for generations, and they’ve always had the same level! If I accept your bucket, my bucket collection will become less coherent, and the magic will go away!”

“But your current buckets don’t have anything to do with the sheep!” protests Autrey.

Mark looks exasperated. “Look, I’ve explained before, there’s obviously no way that sheep can interact with buckets. Buckets can only interact with other buckets.”

“I toss in a pebble whenever a sheep passes,” I point out.

“When a sheep passes, you toss in a pebble?” Mark says. “What does that have to do with anything?”

“It’s an interaction between the sheep and the pebbles,” I reply.

“No, it’s an interaction between the pebbles and you,” Mark says. “The magic doesn’t come from the sheep, it comes from you. Mere sheep are obviously nonmagical. The magic has to come from somewhere, on the way to the bucket.”

I point at a wooden mechanism perched on the gate. “Do you see that flap of cloth hanging down from that wooden contraption? We’re still fiddling with that—it doesn’t work reliably—but when sheep pass through, they disturb the cloth. When the cloth moves aside, a pebble drops out of a reservoir and falls into the bucket. That way, Autrey and I won’t have to toss in the pebbles ourselves.”

Mark furrows his brow. “I don’t quite follow you . . . is the cloth magical?”

I shrug. “I ordered it online from a company called Natural Selections. The fabric is called Sensory Modality.” I pause, seeing the incredulous expressions of Mark and Autrey. “I admit the names are a bit New Agey. The point is that a passing sheep triggers a chain of cause and effect that ends with a pebble in the bucket. Afterward you can compare the bucket to other buckets, and so on.”

“I still don’t get it,” Mark says. “You can’t fit a sheep into a bucket. Only pebbles go in buckets, and it’s obvious that pebbles only interact with other pebbles.”

“The sheep interact with things that interact with pebbles . . .” I search for an analogy. “Suppose you look down at your shoelaces. A photon leaves the Sun; then travels down through Earth’s atmosphere; then bounces off your shoelaces; then passes through the pupil of your eye; then strikes the retina; then is absorbed by a rod or a cone. The photon’s energy makes the attached neuron fire, which causes other neurons to fire. A neural activation pattern in your visual cortex can interact with your beliefs about your shoelaces, since beliefs about shoelaces also exist in neural substrate. If you can understand that, you should be able to see how a passing sheep causes a pebble to enter the bucket.”

“At exactly which point in the process does the pebble become magic?” says Mark.

“It . . . um . . .” Now I’m starting to get confused. I shake my head to clear away cobwebs. This all seemed simple enough when I woke up this morning, and the pebble-and-bucket system hasn’t gotten any more complicated since then. “This is a lot easier to understand if you remember that the point of the system is to keep track of sheep.”

Mark sighs sadly. “Never mind . . . it’s obvious you don’t know. Maybe all pebbles are magical to start with, even before they enter the bucket. We could call that position panpebblism.”

“Ha!” Autrey says, scorn rich in his voice. “Mere wishful thinking! Not all pebbles are created equal. The pebbles in your bucket are not magical. They’re only lumps of stone!”

Mark’s face turns stern. “Now,” he cries, “now you see the danger of the road you walk! Once you say that some people’s pebbles are magical and some are not, your pride will consume you! You will think yourself superior to all others, and so fall! Many throughout history have tortured and murdered because they thought their own pebbles supreme!” A tinge of condescension enters Mark’s voice. “Worshipping a level of pebbles as ‘magical’ implies that there’s an absolute pebble level in a Supreme Bucket. Nobody believes in a Supreme Bucket these days.”

“One,” I say. “Sheep are not absolute pebbles. Two, I don’t think my bucket actually contains the sheep. Three, I don’t worship my bucket level as perfect—I adjust it sometimes—and I do that because I care about the sheep.”

“Besides,” says Autrey, “if someone believes that possessing absolute pebbles would license torture and murder, they’re making a mistake that has nothing to do with buckets. You’re solving the wrong problem.”

Mark calms himself down. “I suppose I can’t expect any better from mere shepherds. You probably believe that snow is white, don’t you.”

“Um . . . yes?” says Autrey.

“It doesn’t bother you that Joseph Stalin believed that snow is white?”

“Um . . . no?” says Autrey.

Mark gazes incredulously at Autrey, and finally shrugs. “Let’s suppose, purely for the sake of argument, that your pebbles are magical and mine aren’t. Can you tell me what the difference is?”

“My pebbles represent the sheep!” Autrey says triumphantly. “Your pebbles don’t have the representativeness property, so they won’t work. They are empty of meaning. Just look at them. There’s no aura of semantic content; they are merely pebbles. You need a bucket with special causal powers.”

“Ah!” Mark says. “Special causal powers, instead of magic.”

“Exactly,” says Autrey. “I’m not superstitious. Postulating magic, in this day and age, would be unacceptable to the international shepherding community. We have found that postulating magic simply doesn’t work as an explanation for shepherding phenomena. So when I see something I don’t understand, and I want to explain it using a model with no internal detail that makes no predictions even in retrospect, I postulate special causal powers. Or I’ll call it an emergent phenomenon, or something.”

“What kind of special powers does the bucket have?” asks Mark.

“Hm,” says Autrey. “Maybe this bucket is imbued with an about-ness relation to the pastures. That would explain why it worked—when the bucket is empty, it means the pastures are empty.”

“Where did you find this bucket?” says Mark. “And how did you realize it had an about-ness relation to the pastures?”

“It’s an ordinary bucket,” I say. “I used to climb trees with it . . . I don’t think this question needs to be difficult.”

“I’m talking to Autrey,” says Mark.

“You have to bind the bucket to the pastures, and the pebbles to the sheep, using a magical ritual—pardon me, an emergent process with special causal powers—that my master discovered,” Autrey explains.

Autrey then attempts to describe the ritual, with Mark nodding along in sage comprehension.

“You have to throw in a pebble every time a sheep leaves through the gate?” says Mark. “Take out a pebble every time a sheep returns?”

Autrey nods. “Yeah.”

“That must be really hard,” Mark says sympathetically.

Autrey brightens, soaking up Mark’s sympathy like rain. “Exactly!” says Autrey. “It’s extremely hard on your emotions. When the bucket has held its level for a while, you . . . tend to get attached to that level.”

A sheep passes then, leaving through the gate. Autrey sees; he stoops, picks up a pebble, holds it aloft in the air. “Behold!” Autrey proclaims. “A sheep has passed! I must now toss a pebble into this bucket, my dear bucket, and destroy that fond level which has held for so long—” Another sheep passes. Autrey, caught up in his drama, misses it, so I plunk a pebble into the bucket. Autrey is still speaking: “—for that is the supreme test of the shepherd, to throw in the pebble, be it ever so agonizing, be the old level ever so precious. Indeed, only the best of shepherds can meet a requirement so stern—”

“Autrey,” I say, “if you want to be a great shepherd someday, learn to shut up and throw in the pebble. No fuss. No drama. Just do it.”

“And this ritual,” says Mark, “it binds the pebbles to the sheep by the magical laws of Sympathy and Contagion, like a voodoo doll.”

Autrey winces and looks around. “Please! Don’t call it Sympathy and Contagion. We shepherds are an anti-superstitious folk. Use the word ‘intentionality,’ or something like that.”

“Can I look at a pebble?” says Mark.

“Sure,” I say. I take one of the pebbles out of the bucket, and toss it to Mark. Then I reach to the ground, pick up another pebble, and drop it into the bucket.

Autrey looks at me, puzzled. “Didn’t you just mess it up?”

I shrug. “I don’t think so. We’ll know I messed it up if there’s a dead sheep next morning, or if we search for a few hours and don’t find any sheep.”

“But—” Autrey says.

“I taught you everything you know, but I haven’t taught you everything I know,” I say.

Mark is examining the pebble, staring at it intently. He holds his hand over the pebble and mutters a few words, then shakes his head. “I don’t sense any magical power,” he says. “Pardon me. I don’t sense any intentionality.”

“A pebble only has intentionality if it’s inside a ma—an emergent bucket,” says Autrey. “Otherwise it’s just a mere pebble.”

“Not a problem,” I say. I take a pebble out of the bucket, and toss it away. Then I walk over to where Mark stands, tap his hand holding a pebble, and say: “I declare this hand to be part of the magic bucket!” Then I resume my post at the gates.

Autrey laughs. “Now you’re just being gratuitously evil.”

I nod, for this is indeed the case.

“Is that really going to work, though?” says Autrey.

I nod again, hoping that I’m right. I’ve done this before with two buckets, and in principle, there should be no difference between Mark’s hand and a bucket. Even if Mark’s hand is imbued with the Élan vital that distinguishes live matter from dead matter, the trick should work as well as if Mark were a marble statue.

Mark is looking at his hand, a bit unnerved. “So . . . the pebble has intentionality again, now?”

“Yep,” I say. “Don’t add any more pebbles to your hand, or throw away the one you have, or you’ll break the ritual.”

Mark nods solemnly. Then he resumes inspecting the pebble. “I understand now how your flocks grew so great,” Mark says. “With the power of this bucket, you could keep on tossing pebbles, and the sheep would keep returning from the fields. You could start with just a few sheep, let them leave, then fill the bucket to the brim before they returned. And if tending so many sheep grew tedious, you could let them all leave, then empty almost all the pebbles from the bucket, so that only a few returned . . . increasing the flocks again when it came time for shearing . . . dear heavens, man! Do you realize the sheer power of this ritual you’ve discovered? I can only imagine the implications; humankind might leap ahead a decade—no, a century!”

“It doesn’t work that way,” I say. “If you add a pebble when a sheep hasn’t left, or remove a pebble when a sheep hasn’t come in, that breaks the ritual. The power does not linger in the pebbles, but vanishes all at once, like a soap bubble popping.”

Mark’s face is terribly disappointed. “Are you sure?”

I nod. “I tried that and it didn’t work.”

Mark sighs heavily. “And this . . . math. . . seemed so powerful and useful until then . . . Oh, well. So much for human progress.”

“Mark, it was a brilliant idea,” Autrey says encouragingly. “The notion didn’t occur to me, and yet it’s so obvious . . . it would save an enormous amount of effort . . . there must be a way to salvage your plan! We could try different buckets, looking for one that would keep the magical pow—the intentionality in the pebbles, even without the ritual. Or try other pebbles. Maybe our pebbles just have the wrong properties to have inherent intentionality. What if we tried it using stones carved to resemble tiny sheep? Or just write ‘sheep’ on the pebbles; that might be enough.”

“Not going to work,” I predict dryly.

Autrey continues. “Maybe we need organic pebbles, instead of silicon pebbles . . . or maybe we need to use expensive gemstones. The price of gemstones doubles every eighteen months, so you could buy a handful of cheap gemstones now, and wait, and in twenty years they’d be really expensive.”

“You tried adding pebbles to create more sheep, and it didn’t work?” Mark asks me. “What exactly did you do?”

“I took a handful of dollar bills. Then I hid the dollar bills under a fold of my blanket, one by one; each time I hid another bill, I took another paperclip from a box, making a small heap. I was careful not to keep track in my head, so that all I knew was that there were ‘many’ dollar bills, and ‘many’ paperclips. Then when all the bills were hidden under my blanket, I added a single additional paperclip to the heap, the equivalent of tossing an extra pebble into the bucket. Then I started taking dollar bills from under the fold, and putting the paperclips back into the box. When I finished, a single paperclip was left over.”

“What does that result mean?” asks Autrey.

“It means the trick didn’t work. Once I broke ritual by that single misstep, the power did not linger, but vanished instantly; the heap of paperclips and the pile of dollar bills no longer went empty at the same time.”

“You actually tried this?” asks Mark.

“Yes,” I say, “I actually performed the experiment, to verify that the outcome matched my theoretical prediction. I have a sentimental fondness for the scientific method, even when it seems absurd. Besides, what if I’d been wrong?”

“If it had worked,” says Mark, “you would have been guilty of counterfeiting! Imagine if everyone did that; the economy would collapse! Everyone would have billions of dollars of currency, yet there would be nothing for money to buy!”

“Not at all,” I reply. “By that same logic whereby adding another paperclip to the heap creates another dollar bill, creating another dollar bill would create an additional dollar’s worth of goods and services.”

Mark shakes his head. “Counterfeiting is still a crime . . . You should not have tried.”

“I was reasonably confident I would fail.”

“Aha!” says Mark. “You expected to fail! You didn’t believe you could do it!”

“Indeed,” I admit. “You have guessed my expectations with stunning accuracy.”

“Well, that’s the problem,” Mark says briskly. “Magic is fueled by belief and willpower. If you don’t believe you can do it, you can’t. You need to change your belief about the experimental result, if we are to change the result itself.”

“Funny,” I say nostalgically, “that’s what Autrey said when I told him about the pebble-and-bucket method. That it was too ridiculous for him to believe, so it wouldn’t work for him.”

“How did you persuade him?” inquires Mark.

“I told him to shut up and follow instructions,” I say, “and when the method worked, Autrey started believing in it.”

Mark frowns, puzzled. “That makes no sense. It doesn’t resolve the essential chicken-and-egg dilemma.”

“Sure it does. The bucket method works whether or not you believe in it.”

“That’s absurd!” sputters Mark. “I don’t believe in magic that works whether or not you believe in it!”

“I said that too,” chimes in Autrey. “Apparently I was wrong.”

Mark screws up his face in concentration. “But . . . if you didn’t believe in magic that works whether or not you believe in it, then why did the bucket method work when you didn’t believe in it? Did you believe in magic that works whether or not you believe in it whether or not you believe in magic that works whether or not you believe in it?”

“I don’t . . . think so . . .” says Autrey doubtfully.

“Then if you didn’t believe in magic that works whether or not you . . . hold on a second, I need to work this out with paper and pencil—” Mark scribbles frantically, looks skeptically at the result, turns the piece of paper upside down, then gives up. “Never mind,” says Mark. “Magic is difficult enough for me to comprehend; metamagic is out of my depth.”

“Mark, I don’t think you understand the art of bucketcraft,” I say. “It’s not about using pebbles to control sheep. It’s about making sheep control pebbles. In this art, it is not necessary to begin by believing the art will work. Rather, first the art works, then one comes to believe that it works.”

“Or so you believe,” says Mark.

“So I believe,” I reply, “because it happens to be a fact. The correspondence between reality and my beliefs comes from reality controlling my beliefs, not the other way around.”

Another sheep passes, causing me to toss in another pebble.

“Ah! Now we come to the root of the problem,” says Mark. “What’s this so-called ‘reality’ business? I understand what it means for a hypothesis to be elegant, or falsifiable, or compatible with the evidence. It sounds to me like calling a belief ‘true’ or ‘real’ or ‘actual’ is merely the difference between saying you believe something, and saying you really really believe something.”

I pause. “Well . . .” I say slowly. “Frankly, I’m not entirely sure myself where this ‘reality’ business comes from. I can’t create my own reality in the lab, so I must not understand it yet. But occasionally I believe strongly that something is going to happen, and then something else happens instead. I need a name for whatever-it-is that determines my experimental results, so I call it ‘reality’. This ‘reality’ is somehow separate from even my very best hypotheses. Even when I have a simple hypothesis, strongly supported by all the evidence I know, sometimes I’m still surprised. So I need different names for the thingies that determine my predictions and the thingy that determines my experimental results. I call the former thingies ‘belief,’ and the latter thingy ‘reality.’ ”

Mark snorts. “I don’t even know why I bother listening to this obvious nonsense. Whatever you say about this so-called ‘reality,’ it is merely another belief. Even your belief that reality precedes your beliefs is a belief. It follows, as a logical inevitability, that reality does not exist; only beliefs exist.”

“Hold on,” says Autrey, “could you repeat that last part? You lost me with that sharp swerve there in the middle.”

“No matter what you say about reality, it’s just another belief,” explains Mark. “It follows with crushing necessity that there is no reality, only beliefs.”

“I see,” I say. “The same way that no matter what you eat, you need to eat it with your mouth. It follows that there is no food, only mouths.”

“Precisely,” says Mark. “Everything that you eat has to be in your mouth. How can there be food that exists outside your mouth? The thought is nonsense, proving that ‘food’ is an incoherent notion. That’s why we’re all starving to death; there’s no food.”

Autrey looks down at his stomach. “But I’m not starving to death.”

“Aha!” shouts Mark triumphantly. “And how did you utter that very objection? With your mouth, my friend! With your mouth! What better demonstration could you ask that there is no food?”

“What’s this about starvation?” demands a harsh, rasping voice from directly behind us. Autrey and I stay calm, having gone through this before. Mark leaps a foot in the air, startled almost out of his wits.

Inspector Darwin smiles tightly, pleased at achieving surprise, and makes a small tick on his clipboard.

“Just a metaphor!” Mark says quickly. “You don’t need to take away my mouth, or anything like that—”

“Why do you need a mouth if there is no food?” demands Darwin angrily. “Never mind. I have no time for this foolishness. I am here to inspect the sheep.”

“Flock’s thriving, sir,” I say. “No dead sheep since January.”

“Excellent. I award you 0.12 units of fitness. Now what is this person doing here? Is he a necessary part of the operations?”

“As far as I can see, he would be of more use to the human species if hung off a hot-air balloon as ballast,” I say.

“Ouch,” says Autrey mildly.

“I do not care about the human species. Let him speak for himself.”

Mark draws himself up haughtily. “This mere shepherd,” he says, gesturing at me, “has claimed that there is such a thing as reality. This offends me, for I know with deep and abiding certainty that there is no truth. The concept of ‘truth’ is merely a stratagem for people to impose their own beliefs on others. Every culture has a different ‘truth,’ and no culture’s ‘truth’ is superior to any other. This that I have said holds at all times in all places, and I insist that you agree.”

“Hold on a second,” says Autrey. “If nothing is true, why should I believe you when you say that nothing is true?”

“I didn’t say that nothing is true—” says Mark.

“Yes, you did,” interjects Autrey, “I heard you.”

“—I said that ‘truth’ is an excuse used by some cultures to enforce their beliefs on others. So when you say something is ‘true,’ you mean only that it would be advantageous to your own social group to have it believed.”

“And this that you have said,” I say, “is it true?”

“Absolutely, positively true!” says Mark emphatically. “People create their own realities.”

“Hold on,” says Autrey, sounding puzzled again, “saying that people create their own realities is, logically, a completely separate issue from saying that there is no truth, a state of affairs I cannot even imagine coherently, perhaps because you still have not explained how exactly it is supposed to work—”

“There you go again,” says Mark exasperatedly, “trying to apply your Western concepts of logic, rationality, reason, coherence, and self-consistency.”

“Great,” mutters Autrey, “now I need to add a third subject heading, to keep track of this entirely separate and distinct claim—”

“It’s not separate,” says Mark. “Look, you’re taking the wrong attitude by treating my statements as hypotheses, and carefully deriving their consequences. You need to think of them as fully general excuses, which I apply when anyone says something I don’t like. It’s not so much a model of how the universe works, as a Get Out of Jail Free card. The key is to apply the excuse selectively. When I say that there is no such thing as truth, that applies only to your claim that the magic bucket works whether or not I believe in it. It does not apply to my claim that there is no such thing as truth.”

“Um . . . why not?” inquires Autrey.

Mark heaves a patient sigh. “Autrey, do you think you’re the first person to think of that question? To ask us how our own beliefs can be meaningful if all beliefs are meaningless? That’s the same thing many students say when they encounter this philosophy, which, I’ll have you know, has many adherents and an extensive literature.”

“So what’s the answer?” says Autrey.

“We named it the ‘reflexivity problem,’ ” explains Mark.

“But what’s the answer?” persists Autrey.

Mark smiles condescendingly. “Believe me, Autrey, you’re not the first person to think of such a simple question. There’s no point in presenting it to us as a triumphant refutation.”

“But what’s the actual answer?”

“Now, I’d like to move on to the issue of how logic kills cute baby seals—”

“You are wasting time,” snaps Inspector Darwin.

“Not to mention, losing track of sheep,” I say, tossing in another pebble.

Inspector Darwin looks at the two arguers, both apparently unwilling to give up their positions. “Listen,” Darwin says, more kindly now, “I have a simple notion for resolving your dispute. You say,” says Darwin, pointing to Mark, “that people’s beliefs alter their personal realities. And you fervently believe,” his finger swivels to point at Autrey, “that Mark’s beliefs can’t alter reality. So let Mark believe really hard that he can fly, and then step off a cliff. Mark shall see himself fly away like a bird, and Autrey shall see him plummet down and go splat, and you shall both be happy.”

We all pause, considering this.

“It sounds reasonable . . .” Mark says finally.

“There’s a cliff right there,” observes Inspector Darwin.

Autrey is wearing a look of intense concentration. Finally he shouts: “Wait! If that were true, we would all have long since departed into our own private universes, in which case the other people here are only figments of your imagination—there’s no point in trying to prove anything to us—”

A long dwindling scream comes from the nearby cliff, followed by a dull and lonely splat. Inspector Darwin flips his clipboard to the page that shows the current gene pool and pencils in a slightly lower frequency for Mark’s alleles.

Autrey looks slightly sick. “Was that really necessary?”

“Necessary?” says Inspector Darwin, sounding puzzled. “It just happened. . . I don’t quite understand your question.”

Autrey and I turn back to our bucket. It’s time to bring in the sheep. You wouldn’t want to forget about that part. Otherwise what would be the point?
