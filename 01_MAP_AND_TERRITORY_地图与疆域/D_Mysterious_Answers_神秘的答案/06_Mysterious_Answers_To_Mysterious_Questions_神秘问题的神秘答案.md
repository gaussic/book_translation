## 神秘问题的神秘答案

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

想象你看着自己的手，对细胞一无所知，对生物化学一无所知，对 DNA 也一无所知。你通过解剖学学到了一些知识，知道你的手里有肌肉；但你不知道为什么肌肉会动，而不是像黏土一样静静地躺着。你的手只是……一团物质……但出于某种原因，它会按照你的意志运动。这难道不是魔法吗？

这就是活力论（vitalism）：用“生命力”（Élan vital 或 vis vitalis）来解释有生命物质与无生命物质之间神秘的差异。生命力注入到活的物质中，使其能按照有意识的意志运动。生命力参与了无生命粒子无法进行的化学转化——后来 Wöhler 合成了尿素（一种尿液成分），这对活力论是一次重大打击，因为它表明单纯的化学过程也能复制生物产物。

把“生命力”称为一种解释，甚至说它是像燃素那样的伪解释，可能都太抬举它了。它的主要作用其实是好奇心终止符。你问“为什么？”，答案就是“生命力！”

当你说“生命力！”时，你会觉得自己知道了手为什么会动。你脑中有一个小小的因果图：

    生命力！ -----> 手会动

但实际上，你并没有比之前知道得更多。比如，你并不知道你的手会产生热量还是吸收热量，除非你已经观察到这个事实；否则你无法提前预测。你的好奇心得到了满足，但其实并没有被喂养。因为你可以对任何观察都说“为什么？生命力！”，所以它对所有结果的解释能力是一样的，本质上就是伪装起来的最大熵假说，等等。

但更深刻的教训在于，活力论者对“生命力”的崇拜，以及他们急于把它宣布为超越一切科学的神秘。当面对“未知”这条巨龙时，活力论者没有拔剑战斗，而是低头臣服。他们以自己的无知为傲，把生物学变成了神圣的谜团，因此当证据敲门时，他们也不愿放弃自己的无知。

生命的秘密远远超出了科学的触及范围！不是稍微超出，而是无限超出！开尔文勋爵显然非常享受“不知道某事”带来的情感快感。

但无知存在于地图中，而不是疆域中。如果我对某个现象无知，那只是我自己心智状态的事实，而不是现象本身的事实。某个现象对某个人来说可以显得神秘，但没有哪种现象本身就是神秘的。因为某个现象看起来神秘而去崇拜它，其实是在崇拜自己的无知。

活力论和燃素理论一样，都犯了把谜团实体化为某种物质的错误。火很神秘，燃素理论就把谜团包裹在“燃素”这种神秘物质里。生命是神圣的谜团，活力论就把神圣的谜团包裹在“生命力”这种神秘物质里。这两种“答案”都没有帮助模型集中概率密度——没有让某些结果比其他结果更容易解释。这种“解释”只是把问题包裹成一个小而坚硬、不透明的黑球。

在莫里哀的一部喜剧中，一位医生解释安眠药的作用时说，它含有“催眠效力”。同理。这正是人类心理的失败：面对神秘现象时，我们更容易假设有神秘的内在物质，而不是复杂的底层过程。

但更深层的失败，是以为答案本身可以是神秘的。如果某个现象让人觉得神秘，那只是我们知识状态的事实，而不是现象本身的事实。活力论者看到自己知识中的神秘空白，就假设有某种神秘物质来填补这个空白。这样做，他们混淆了地图和疆域。所有的困惑和迷惑都存在于头脑中，而不是某种被包裹的物质里。

这就是为什么在人类历史上，一次又一次地，人们会惊讶地发现极其神秘的问题其实有一个一点也不神秘的答案的终极、普适解释。神秘是问题的属性，而不是答案的属性。

因此，我把活力论这类理论称为“神秘问题的神秘答案”。

神秘问题的神秘答案有以下特征：

- 首先，这种解释是好奇心终止符，而不是预期控制器。
- 其次，这个假说没有任何“活动部件”——模型不是具体复杂的机制，而是一个空洞的实体或力量。神秘的物质或力量可以说在这里或那里，能导致这个或那个，但它为什么会这样，理由被包裹在一个空白的整体里。
- 第三，提出这种解释的人以自己的无知为傲；他们会自豪地说这个现象击败了普通科学，或与世俗现象完全不同。
- 第四，即使给出了答案，这个现象依然是个谜，依然保有最初那种奇妙的不可解释性。

## Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Imagine looking at your hand, and knowing nothing of cells, nothing of biochemistry, nothing of DNA. You’ve learned some anatomy from dissection, so you know your hand contains muscles; but you don’t know why muscles move instead of lying there like clay. Your hand is just . . . stuff . . . and for some reason it moves under your direction. Is this not magic?

> It seemed to me then, and it still seems to me, most probable that the animal body does not act as a thermodynamic engine . . . The influence of animal or vegetable life on matter is infinitely beyond the range of any scientific inquiry hitherto entered on. Its power of directing the motions of moving particles, in the demonstrated daily miracle of our human free-will, and in the growth of generation after generation of plants from a single seed, are infinitely different from any possible result of the fortuitous concourse of atoms[.]<sup>1</sup>

It appears, therefore, that animated creatures have the power of immediately applying, to certain moving particles of matter within their bodies, forces by which the motions of these particles are directed to produce desired mechanical effects.<sup>2</sup>

This was the theory of vitalism ; that the mysterious difference between living matter and non-living matter was explained by an Élan vital or vis vitalis. Élan vital infused living matter and caused it to move as consciously directed. Élan vital participated in chemical transformations which no mere non-living particles could undergo—Wöhler’s later synthesis of urea, a component of urine, was a major blow to the vitalistic theory because it showed that mere chemistry could duplicate a product of biology.

Calling “Élan vital” an explanation, even a fake explanation like phlogiston, is probably giving it too much credit. It functioned primarily as a curiosity-stopper. You said “Why?” and the answer was “Élan vital!”

When you say “Élan vital!” it feels like you know why your hand moves. You have a little causal diagram in your head that says:

	Élan Vital! -----> Hand Moves

But actually you know nothing you didn’t know before. You don’t know, say, whether your hand will generate heat or absorb heat, unless you have observed the fact already; if not, you won’t be able to predict it in advance. Your curiosity feels sated, but it hasn’t been fed. Since you can say “Why? Élan vital!” to any possible observation, it is equally good at explaining all outcomes, a disguised hypothesis of maximum entropy, et cetera.

But the greater lesson lies in the vitalists’ reverence for the Élan vital, their eagerness to pronounce it a mystery beyond all science. Meeting the great dragon Unknown, the vitalists did not draw their swords to do battle, but bowed their necks in submission. They took pride in their ignorance, made biology into a sacred mystery, and thereby became loath to [relinquish their ignorance](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality/twelve-virtues-of-rationality) when evidence came knocking.

The Secret of Life was infinitely beyond the reach of science! Not just a little beyond, mind you, but infinitely beyond! Lord Kelvin sure did get a tremendous emotional kick out of not knowing something.

But ignorance exists in the map, not in the territory. If I am ignorant about a phenomenon, that is a fact about my own state of mind, not a fact about the phenomenon itself. A phenomenon can seem mysterious to some particular person. There are no phenomena which are mysterious of themselves. To worship a phenomenon because it seems so wonderfully mysterious is to worship your own ignorance.

Vitalism shared with phlogiston the error of encapsulating the mystery as a substance. Fire was mysterious, and the phlogiston theory encapsulated the mystery in a mysterious substance called “phlogiston.” Life was a sacred mystery, and vitalism encapsulated the sacred mystery in a mysterious substance called “Élan vital.” Neither answer helped concentrate the model’s probability density—helped make some outcomes easier to explain than others. The “explanation” just wrapped up the question as a small, hard, opaque black ball.

In a comedy written by Molière, a physician explains the power of a soporific by saying that it contains a “dormitive potency.” Same principle. It is a failure of human psychology that, faced with a mysterious phenomenon, we more readily postulate mysterious inherent substances than complex underlying processes.

But the deeper failure is supposing that an answer can be mysterious. If a phenomenon feels mysterious, that is a fact about our state of knowledge, not a fact about the phenomenon itself. The vitalists saw a mysterious gap in their knowledge, and postulated a mysterious stuff that plugged the gap. In doing so, they mixed up the map with the territory. All confusion and bewilderment exist in the mind, not in encapsulated substances.

This is the ultimate and fully general explanation for why, again and again in humanity’s history, people are shocked to discover that an incredibly mysterious question has a non-mysterious answer. Mystery is a property of questions, not answers.

Therefore I call theories such as vitalism mysterious answers to mysterious questions.

These are the signs of mysterious answers to mysterious questions:

- First, the explanation acts as a curiosity-stopper rather than an anticipation-controller.
- Second, the hypothesis has no moving parts—the model is not a specific complex mechanism, but a blankly solid substance or force. The mysterious substance or mysterious force may be said to be here or there, to cause this or that; but the reason why the mysterious force behaves thus is wrapped in a blank unity.
- Third, those who proffer the explanation cherish their ignorance; they speak proudly of how the phenomenon defeats ordinary science or is unlike merely mundane phenomena.
- Fourth, even after the answer is given, the phenomenon is still a mystery and possesses the same quality of wonderful inexplicability that it had at the start.
