## “涌现”的无用性

燃素和活力论的失败是历史的后见之明。那么，我敢不敢冒险，指出一些我认为同样有缺陷的当代理论？

我点名“涌现”或“涌现现象”——通常被定义为研究那些高层行为由许多低层元素相互作用“涌现”出来的系统。（维基百科：“复杂系统和模式如何从大量相对简单的相互作用中产生。”）如果按字面理解，这种描述适用于宇宙中所有高于夸克层次的现象，这本身就是问题的一部分。想象你指着一次股市崩盘说：“这不是夸克！”你觉得这是解释吗？不是吧？那么，说“这是涌现现象！”也同样不是解释。

我反对的是“涌现”这个名词，而不是“从……涌现”这个动词。说“X 从 Y 涌现出来”，只要 Y 是某个具体、详细、有内部活动部件的模型，这没什么问题。“源自于”也是同样合法的说法，意思完全一样。比如，根据广义相对论的具体数学模型，重力源自时空的弯曲；根据量子电动力学的具体模型，化学源自原子之间的相互作用。

但假如我说重力依赖于“源生性”，或者化学是一种“源生现象”，并把这当作解释，你会怎么想？

“从……涌现”这样的说法是可以接受的，就像“源自于”或“由……导致”一样，只要后面跟着具体模型，可以凭其自身优劣来判断。

然而，“涌现”在现实中常常不是这样用的。它经常被当作一种解释本身。

我已经记不清有多少次听到有人说：“智能是一种涌现现象！”仿佛这就解释了智能。这种用法完全符合“神秘问题的神秘答案”的所有特征。当你说“智能是涌现的”之后，你到底知道了什么？你无法做出任何新预测。你对现实世界心智的行为并没有比之前了解更多。你感觉好像相信了一个新事实，但你并不预期会有任何不同的结果。你的好奇心得到了满足的错觉，但其实并没有被真正喂养。这个假说没有活动部件——没有可以操作的详细内部模型。提出“涌现”假说的人坦率承认自己对内部机制一无所知，并以此为傲；他们把“涌现科学”与其他“平庸”的科学对比。

而且，即使你给出了“为什么？因为涌现！”这个答案，这个现象依然是个谜，依然保留着最初那种神圣的不可理解感。

一个有趣的练习是，把任何句子里的“涌现”形容词去掉，看看句子有没有变化：
- 原句：人类智能是神经元放电的涌现产物。
- 去掉后：人类智能是神经元放电的产物。
- 原句：蚁群的行为是许多蚂蚁相互作用的涌现结果。
- 去掉后：蚁群的行为是许多蚂蚁相互作用的结果。
- 更好的说法：一个蚁群由蚂蚁组成。我们可以用只包含单个蚂蚁的模型（没有全局蚁群变量）成功预测蚁群行为的某些方面，这说明我们理解了这些群体行为是如何由个体行为产生的。

另一个有趣的练习是，把“涌现”换成以前人们用的那个词：

- 原句：生命是一种涌现现象。
- 替换后：生命是一种魔法现象。
- 原句：人类智能是神经元放电的涌现产物。
- 替换后：人类智能是神经元放电的魔法产物。

每一句话对现象行为的知识量是不是完全一样？每个假说是不是都适用于完全一样的结果？

“涌现”变得非常流行，就像过去说“魔法”一样流行。“涌现”对人类心理有着同样深刻的吸引力，原因也一样。“涌现”是个极其轻松的解释，说出来让人感觉良好；它给了你一个神圣的谜团可以膜拜。涌现之所以流行，是因为它是好奇心的垃圾食品。你可以用“涌现”来解释任何事物，所以人们就真的这么做了；因为解释事物的感觉太美妙了。

人类终究还是人类，即使他们在大学上过几门科学课。一旦他们找到逃离既定科学束缚的方法，他们就会像祖先一样胡闹——只是披上了“科学”文学类型的外衣，但人类还是人类，人类心理还是人类心理。

## The Futility of Emergence

The failures of phlogiston and vitalism are historical hindsight. Dare I step out on a limb, and name some current theory which I deem analogously flawed?

I name emergence or emergent phenomena—usually defined as the study of systems whose high-level behaviors arise or “emerge” from the interaction of many low-level elements. (Wikipedia: “The way complex systems and patterns arise out of a multiplicity of relatively simple interactions.”) Taken literally, that description fits every phenomenon in our universe above the level of individual quarks, which is part of the problem. Imagine pointing to a market crash and saying “It’s not a quark!” Does that feel like an explanation? No? Then neither should saying “It’s an emergent phenomenon!”

It’s the noun “emergence” that I protest, rather than the verb “emerges from.” There’s nothing wrong with saying “X emerges from Y , ” where Y is some specific, detailed model with internal moving parts. “Arises from” is another legitimate phrase that means exactly the same thing. Gravity arises from the curvature of spacetime, according to the specific mathematical model of General Relativity. Chemistry arises from interactions between atoms, according to the specific model of quantum electrodynamics.

Now suppose I should say that gravity depends on “arisence” or that chemistry is an “arising phenomenon,” and claim that as my explanation. 

The phrase “emerges from” is acceptable, just like “arises from” or “is caused by” are acceptable, if the phrase precedes some specific model to be judged on its own merits.

However, this is not the way “emergence” is commonly used. “Emergence” is commonly used as an explanation in its own right.

I have lost track of how many times I have heard people say, “Intelligence is an emergent phenomenon!” as if that explained intelligence. This usage fits all the checklist items for a mysterious answer to a mysterious question. What do you know, after you have said that intelligence is “emergent”? You can make no new predictions. You do not know anything about the behavior of real-world minds that you did not know before. It feels like you believe a new fact, but you don’t anticipate any different outcomes. Your curiosity feels sated, but it has not been fed. The hypothesis has no moving parts—there’s no detailed internal model to manipulate. Those who proffer the hypothesis of “emergence” confess their ignorance of the internals, and take pride in it; they contrast the science of “emergence” to other sciences merely mundane.

And even after the answer of “Why? Emergence!” is given, the phenomenon is still a mystery and possesses the same sacred impenetrability it had at the start.

A fun exercise is to eliminate the adjective “emergent” from any sentence in which it appears, and see if the sentence says anything different:
- Before: Human intelligence is an emergent product of neurons firing.
- After: Human intelligence is a product of neurons firing.
- Before: The behavior of the ant colony is the emergent outcome of the interactions of many individual ants.
- After: The behavior of the ant colony is the outcome of the interactions of many individual ants.
- Even better: A colony is made of ants. We can successfully predict some aspects of colony behavior using models that include only individual ants, without any global colony variables, showing that we understand how those colony behaviors arise from ant behaviors.

Another fun exercise is to replace the word “emergent” with the old word, the explanation that people had to use before emergence was invented:

- Before: Life is an emergent phenomenon.
- After: Life is a magical phenomenon.
- Before: Human intelligence is an emergent product of neurons firing.
- After: Human intelligence is a magical product of neurons firing.

Does not each statement convey exactly the same amount of knowledge about the phenomenon’s behavior? Does not each hypothesis fit exactly the same set of outcomes?

“Emergence” has become very popular, just as saying “magic” used to be very popular. “Emergence” has the same deep appeal to human psychology, for the same reason. “Emergence” is such a wonderfully easy explanation, and it feels good to say it; it gives you a sacred mystery to worship. Emergence is popular because it is the junk food of curiosity. You can explain anything using emergence, and so people do just that; for it feels so wonderful to explain things.

Humans are still humans, even if they’ve taken a few science classes in college. Once they find a way to escape the shackles of settled science, they get up to the same shenanigans as their ancestors—dressed up in the literary genre of “science,” but humans are still humans, and human psychology is still human psychology.
