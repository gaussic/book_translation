## 让历史触手可及

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

我有一个思维习惯，我称之为“从虚构证据中推导的逻辑谬误”。例如，一些记者在谈论人工智能时，会提到《终结者》电影，但他们通常并不会将《终结者》当作预言或不容更改的真理。然而，这部电影却被像历史案例一样提及，就仿佛记者亲眼目睹了它在另一个星球上发生，因此它可能在这里也发生。

从虚构证据中推导的错误存在一个反向的错误，那就是未能被历史证据充分触动。归结到从虚构证据中推导的错误，就是它毕竟是虚构的——它并没有真正发生过。它并非来自我们真实宇宙的同一分布；[虚构与现实在系统性上有所不同](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/tell-your-anti-.html)。但历史已经发生，应该是触手可及的。

在我们祖先的环境中，并没有电影；你亲眼看到的才是真的。难怪我们看到的、栩栩如生的虚构画面会对我们产生如此巨大的影响。反过来，历史上真正发生的事情，我们却是通过印刷在纸上的文字接触到的；它们确实发生了，但我们从未亲眼见过它们的发生。我们并不记得它们曾经发生在我们身上。

反向错误就是把历史当作单纯的故事来处理，用你处理小说的方式来对待它。你可能口头上说它是“事实”，而非“虚构”，但这并不意味着你会被它触动到足够的程度。许多偏见都源于我们对[干巴巴的、抽象的信息](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality/scope-insensitivity)不够敏感。

当我最终意识到自己站在了什么位置，回想起给神秘问题的神秘答案时，我突然感到与过去的意外联系。我意识到，生命力主义的发明与毁灭——那些我仅仅从书中读到的事情——实际上发生在了真实的人身上，他们体验它的方式与我体验自己神秘答案的发明与毁灭非常相似。我还意识到，如果我真的经历过过去——如果我亲自经历过过去的科学革命，而不是在历史书中读到它们——我可能就不会再犯同样的错误。我不会再想出另一个神秘的答案；前一千次的教训会让我深刻领悟其中的道理。

于是，我想，若要充分感受历史的力量，我应该试着模拟一个亲历历史的埃利泽——我应该假装自己经历了历史书中所提到的每一件事，假装这些历史事件真的发生在我身上。我应该沉浸在历史中，想象自己生活在那些我只在纸面上看到过的时代。

为什么我要记得莱特兄弟的第一次飞行？我不在场。但作为一个理性主义者，难道我敢忘记这件事吗？这确实发生过，不是吗？亲眼目睹一个事件与通过历史书了解一个事件并没有太大区别；它们同样都是通过因果链条到达我们的。这两个链条——一个是反射光子，另一个是历史书——都源自事件本身。

我必须克服那种虚假的失忆感，那种因为生在某个特定时间而遗忘过去的感觉。我必须回忆起——让它触手可及——所有的记忆，而不仅仅是那些偶然属于我自己和我的时代的记忆。

地球突然变得更加古老了。

在我曾经的记忆中，美国总是存在的——从没有一个没有美国的时代。直到那个时刻，我才没有记起罗马帝国的崛起，和它如何带来和平与秩序，历经数百年，直到我忘记了曾经的世界是怎样的；然而，帝国还是倒塌了，野蛮人涌入了我的城市，我所拥有的学识也随之丧失。现代世界在我眼中变得脆弱；它不是第一个现代世界。

那么多的错误，一遍遍重复，因为我没有记得自己曾经犯过的错误，在每个我从未生活过的时代……

而人们有时还在怀疑克服偏见是否重要。

你不记得多少次偏见差点害死你吗？你不记得？我注意到，突如其来的失忆常常发生在致命错误之后。但相信我，发生过。记住，我在这里——我不在场。

所以下次，当你怀疑未来的怪异时，记得你曾在一万年前生于一个狩猎采集部落，那时没人知道科学。记住，当科学解释你曾经深信的伟大而神圣的神秘时，你曾深深震惊。记住，你曾经相信吃对蘑菇就能飞起来，后来你失望地接受了自己无法飞翔的事实，然后你飞了。记住，你曾经认为奴隶制度是正确的，后来你改变了看法。不要[假装你曾预测过这些变化](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/il/hindsight_bias/)，那样就是失忆。记住，实际上，你并没有猜到。记住，世界是如何在一个世纪又一个世纪中变化的，而这些变化你并没有预料到。

也许那时你会对接下来发生的事情不再那么震惊。

## Making History Available

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

There is a habit of thought which I [cal](http://intelligence.org/files/CognitiveBiases.pdf) the logical fallacy of generalization from fictional evidence. Journalists who, for example, talk about the Terminator movies in a report on AI, do not usually treat Terminator as a prophecy or fixed truth. But the movie is recalled—is available—as if it were an illustrative historical case. As if the journalist had seen it happen on some other planet, so that it might well happen here.

There is an inverse error to generalizing from fictional evidence: failing to be sufficiently moved by historical evidence. The trouble with generalizing from fictional evidence is that it is fiction—it never actually happened. It’s not drawn from the same distribution as this, our real universe; [fiction differs from reality in systematic ways](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/tell-your-anti-.html). But history has happened, and should be available.

In our ancestral environment, there were no movies; what you saw with your own eyes was true. Is it any wonder that fictions we see in lifelike moving pictures have too great an impact on us? Conversely, things that really happened, we encounter as ink on paper; they happened, but we never saw them happen. We don’t remember them happening to us.

The inverse error is to treat history as mere story, process it with the same part of your mind that handles the novels you read. You may say with your lips that it is “truth,” rather than “fiction,” but that doesn’t mean you are being moved as much as you should be. Many biases involve being insufficiently moved by [dry, abstract information](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality/scope-insensitivity).

When I finally realized whose shoes I was standing in, after having given a Mysterious Answer to a mysterious question, there was a sudden shock of unexpected connection with the past. I realized that the invention and destruction of vitalism—which I had only read about in books—had actually happened to real people, who experienced it much the same way I experienced the invention and destruction of my own mysterious answer. And I also realized that if I had actually experienced the past—if I had lived through past scientific revolutions myself, rather than reading about them in history books—I probably would not have made the same mistake again. I would not have come up with another mysterious answer; the first thousand lessons would have hammered home the moral.

So (I thought), to feel sufficiently the force of history, I should try to approximate the thoughts of an Eliezer who had lived through history—I should try to think as if everything I read about in history books had actually happened to me.<sup>1</sup> I should immerse myself in history, imagine living through eras I only saw as ink on paper.

Why should I remember the Wright Brothers’ first flight? I was not there. But as a rationalist, could I dare to not remember, when the event actually happened? Is there so much difference between seeing an event through your eyes—which is actually a causal chain involving reflected photons, not a direct connection—and seeing an event through a history book? Photons and history books both descend by causal chains from the event itself.

I had to overcome the false amnesia of being born at a particular time. I had to recall—make available— all the memories, not just the memories which, by mere coincidence, belonged to myself and my own era.

The Earth became older, of a sudden.

To my former memory, the United States had always existed—there was never a time when there was no United States. I had not remembered, until that time, how the Roman Empire rose, and brought peace and order, and lasted through so many centuries, until I forgot that things had ever been otherwise; and yet the Empire fell, and barbarians overran my city, and the learning that I had possessed was lost. The modern world became more fragile to my eyes; it was not the first modern world.

So many mistakes, made over and over and over again, because I did not remember making them, in every era I never lived . . .

And to think, people sometimes wonder if overcoming bias is important.

Don’t you remember how many times your biases have killed you? You don’t? I’ve noticed that sudden amnesia often follows a fatal mistake. But take it from me, it happened. I remember; I wasn’t there.

So the next time you doubt the strangeness of the future, remember how you were born in a hunter-gatherer tribe ten thousand years ago, when no one knew of Science at all. Remember how you were shocked, to the depths of your being, when Science explained the great and terrible sacred mysteries that you once revered so highly. Remember how you once believed that you could fly by eating the right mushrooms, and then you accepted with disappointment that you would never fly, and then you flew. Remember how you had always thought that slavery was right and proper, and then you changed your mind. Don’t [imagine how you could](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/il/hindsight_bias/) have predicted the change, for that is amnesia. Remember that, in fact, you did not guess. Remember how, century after century, the world changed in ways you did not guess.

Maybe then you will be less shocked by what happens next.
