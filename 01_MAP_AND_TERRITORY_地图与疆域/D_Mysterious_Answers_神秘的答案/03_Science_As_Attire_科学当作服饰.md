## 科学当作服饰

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

X 战警电影的预告片里有一句旁白：“在每个人体内……都存在着……变异的基因密码。”显然，你可以通过变异获得各种酷炫的能力。例如，变种人“暴风女”能召唤闪电。

请你认真思考一下，生物体要产生电能需要怎样的生理结构；要避免被电伤害需要怎样的生物适应；要精确控制闪电还需要怎样的认知回路。如果我们真的观察到某个生物体仅靠一次突变就在一代之内获得这些能力，那将直接推翻新达尔文主义的自然选择模型。这比在前寒武纪地层里发现兔子化石还要离谱。如果进化论能解释暴风女，那它就什么都能解释，而我们都知道这意味着什么。

X 战警漫画用“进化”“变异”“基因密码”这些词，只是为了把自己归入他们心目中的“科学”文学体裁。让我感到害怕的是，不知道有多少人，尤其是媒体从业者，只把科学当作一种文学体裁来理解。

我遇到过一些非常坚定地相信进化论、嘲笑创世论者愚蠢的人。但他们其实根本不知道进化生物学理论允许什么、禁止什么。他们会谈论“人类进化的下一步”，仿佛自然选择是按计划进行的。更糟的是，他们会把完全不属于进化生物学范畴的东西，比如更先进的芯片设计、公司拆分，或者人类上传意识到计算机，都称为“进化”。如果进化生物学能解释这些，那它就什么都能解释。

实际上，大多数相信进化论的人说“因为进化”，只是想融入科学圈子——把信仰当作科学的服饰，就像穿上实验服一样。如果科学圈子用“因为智能设计”这个短语，他们也会同样开心地用它——对他们的预期控制器来说没任何区别。对他们来说，说“因为进化”而不是“因为智能设计”，并不会让他们否定暴风女的存在。这个说法的唯一作用，就是表明自己属于某个部落。

我还遇到过一些人，他们很乐意接受“比人类更笨的人工智能”，甚至“略微比人类聪明的人工智能”。但一提到“远超人类的超级人工智能”，他们立刻就说那是“[伪科学](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/io/is_molecular_nanotechnology_scientific/)”。他们并不是觉得自己有某种智能理论，能计算优化过程的理论上限。实际上，他们只是把超级人工智能归类为“世界末日文学”体裁，而把经营小公司的 AI 归类为《连线》杂志那种体裁。他们并不是在认知模型的框架内说话。他们甚至没意识到自己需要一个模型。他们没意识到科学其实是关于模型的。他们所谓的“有力批评”，其实只是把某个观点和“世界末日文学”做比较，而不是用已知的科学定律来反驳。他们只把科学当作一种文学体裁，或是某个圈子。他们穿的“服饰”在他们看来并不像实验服；这也不是他们支持的橄榄球队。

有没有哪条科学观点，是你引以为傲地相信的，但你并不在专业上用到？你最好问问自己，这个信念究竟禁止了哪些未来体验在你身上发生。那才是你真正吸收并成为自己一部分的全部。除此之外，其他的很可能只是密码或服饰而已。

## Science as Attire

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

The preview for the X-Men movie has a voice-over saying: “In every human being . . . there is the genetic code . . . for mutation.” Apparently you can acquire all sorts of neat abilities by mutation. The mutant Storm, for example, has the ability to throw lightning bolts.

I beg you, dear reader, to consider the biological machinery necessary to generate electricity; the biological adaptations necessary to avoid being harmed by electricity; and the cognitive circuitry required for finely tuned control of lightning bolts. If we actually observed any organism acquiring these abilities in one generation, as the result of mutation, it would outright falsify the neo-Darwinian model of natural selection. It would be worse than finding rabbit fossils in the pre-Cambrian. If evolutionary theory could actually stretch to cover Storm, it would be able to explain anything, and we all know what that would imply.

The X-Men comics use terms like “evolution,” “mutation,” and “genetic code,” purely to place themselves in what they conceive to be the literary genre of science. The part that scares me is wondering how many people, especially in the media, understand science only as a literary genre.

I encounter people who very definitely believe in evolution, who sneer at the folly of creationists. And yet they have no idea of what the theory of evolutionary biology permits and prohibits. They’ll talk about “the next step in the evolution of humanity,” as if natural selection got here by following a plan. Or even worse, they’ll talk about something completely outside the domain of evolutionary biology, like an improved design for computer chips, or corporations splitting, or humans uploading themselves into computers, and they’ll call that “evolution.” If evolutionary biology could cover that, it could cover anything.

Probably an actual majority of the people who believe in evolution use the phrase “because of evolution” because they want to be part of the scientific in-crowd—belief as scientific attire, like wearing a lab coat. If the scientific in-crowd instead used the phrase “because of intelligent design,” they would just as cheerfully use that instead—it would make no difference to their anticipation-controllers. Saying “because of evolution” instead of “because of intelligent design” does not, for them, prohibit Storm. Its only purpose, for them, is to identify with a tribe.

I encounter people who are quite willing to entertain the notion of dumber-than-human artificial intelligence, or even mildly smarter-than-human artificial intelligence. Introduce the notion of strongly superhuman artificial intelligence, and they’ll suddenly decide it’s “[pseudoscience](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/io/is_molecular_nanotechnology_scientific/).” It’s not that they think they have a theory of intelligence which lets them calculate a theoretical upper bound on the power of an optimization process. Rather, they associate strongly superhuman AI to the literary genre of apocalyptic literature; whereas an AI running a small corporation associates to the literary genre of Wired magazine. They aren’t speaking from within a model of cognition. They don’t realize they need a model. They don’t realize that science is about models. Their devastating critiques consist purely of comparisons to apocalyptic literature, rather than, say, known laws which prohibit such an outcome. They understand science only as a literary genre, or in-group to belong to. The attire doesn’t look to them like a lab coat; this isn’t the football team they’re cheering for.

Is there any idea in science that you are proud of believing, though you do not use the belief professionally? You had best ask yourself which future experiences your belief prohibits from happening to you. That is the sum of what you have assimilated and made a true part of yourself. Anything else is probably passwords or attire.
