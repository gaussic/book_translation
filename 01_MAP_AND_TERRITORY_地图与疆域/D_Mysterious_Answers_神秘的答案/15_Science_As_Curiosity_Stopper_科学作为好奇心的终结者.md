## “科学”作为好奇心的终结者

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

想象一下，我站在现场直播镜头前，举起双手，念着“阿布拉卡达布拉”咒语，召唤出一道耀眼的光，闪烁在我伸出的手指外的空中。想象一下，我在詹姆斯·兰迪和所有怀疑论者的监督下，做出了这一明显、不可否认的魔法行为。我想，大多数人会非常好奇发生了什么。

但现在假设我不出现在电视上。我不想分享这个力量，也不想透露其中的真相。我想保持我的魔法秘密。但我也希望无论何时何地都能施展我的魔法。我希望我能随时召唤出这道亮光，让我可以在火车上读书——而没有人对此产生好奇心。有没有一种魔法能够阻止好奇心？

答案是：有的！每当有人问我：“你是怎么做到的？”我只需要回答：“科学！”

这并不是一个真正的解释，而是一个“好奇心终结器”。它没有告诉你光会变亮还是变暗，颜色会变淡还是变浓，当然也没有告诉你如何自己制造类似的光。你实际上并不知道比我说出魔法词之前更多的东西。但你转身离开，心里觉得没什么特别的事情发生。

更妙的是，同样的把戏也适用于普通的开关。

按下开关，灯泡亮了。为什么？

在学校里，人们教你灯泡的密码是“电！”我希望到现在为止，你已经开始警惕，不能仅凭这个就认为自己完全理解了灯泡的工作原理。说“电！”是否能让你做出控制体验预期的计算呢？至少，仍然有很多东西需要学习。<sup>1</sup>

如果你认为灯泡是科学上无法解释的，它会占据你所有的注意力。你会放下你正在做的所有事情，集中精力去观察那个灯泡。

但是，“科学可解释”这个词究竟是什么意思？它的意思是，别人知道灯泡是如何工作的。当你被告知灯泡是“科学可解释”的时候，你并没有知道比以前更多的东西；你仍然不知道灯泡会变亮还是变暗。但因为别人知道，它就贬值了你眼中的知识。你变得不再好奇了。

有人可能会说：“如果灯泡对科学来说是未知的，你可以通过研究它来获得名声和财富。”但我不是在谈论贪婪，我也不是在谈论事业抱负。我在谈论的是好奇心的原始情感——被吸引的感觉。为什么因为别人（而不是你）知道灯泡是怎么工作的，你的好奇心就会减弱？难道这不是一种恶意吗？仅仅知道还不够；别人也必须无知，否则你就不会高兴吗？

知识可以服务于其他目的，比如技术的社会效益。对于这些工具性的好处，别人是否知道确实重要。但对于我自己的好奇心，为什么会在乎别人知道与否？

更何况，考虑一下，如果你让“别人知道答案”成为好奇心的终结者，会有什么后果。一天，你走进客厅，看到一只巨大的绿色大象，似乎漂浮在空中，周围环绕着银色的光环。

“这是什么鬼？”你说。

然后一个声音从大象上方传来，说：

> [有人已经知道这只大象为什么在这里。](http://godescalc.wordpress.com/2012/06/24/overlooked-elephant/)

“哦，”你说，“那没关系，”然后继续走向厨房。

我不知道这个宇宙物理法则的统一理论。我也对人体解剖学知之甚少，除了大脑之外。我甚至不知道自己身体的肾脏在哪里，脑袋里也说不清楚肝脏的具体功能。<sup>2</sup>

在好奇心方面，我是否应该比我对宇宙终极法则的无知，更加好奇自己对身体内部发生的事情一无所知？

如果我举起手，施展一个光明魔法，你会感到好奇。你应该不会因为我只是举起了手而失去好奇心吧？当你举起手臂，挥动手时，这个意志的动作是由（包括其他大脑区域）小脑协调的。我敢打赌你不知道小脑是怎么工作的。我知道一点——虽然只是一些粗略的细节，不够用来进行计算……但那又如何？如果你不知道，那又有什么关系？为什么对魔法和手部动作要有双重标准？

看看镜子里的自己。你知道你在看什么吗？你知道从你眼睛后面看出去的到底是什么吗？你知道你自己是什么吗？其中一些答案科学知道，而其中一些科学不知道。但为什么，如果你自己不知道，这个区别会影响你的好奇心呢？

你知道你的膝盖是怎么运作的吗？你知道你的鞋子是怎么制作的吗？你知道为什么你的电脑显示器会发光吗？你知道为什么水是湿的吗？

你周围的世界充满了谜题。如果必须的话，给它们排个优先级。但不要抱怨残酷的科学已经把世界的神秘性掏空了。凭借这样的推理，我甚至可以让你忽视客厅里的一头大象。

<sup>1</sup>物理学家应该忽略这段，并替换为一个进化论中的问题，因为这个理论的实质也是通过计算，而很少有人知道如何进行这些计算。

<sup>2</sup>我对这一点并不感到骄傲。唉，考虑到我需要学习的数学，近期我可能不会学解剖学。

## “Science” as Curiosity-Stopper

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Imagine that I, in full view of live television cameras, raised my hands and chanted abracadabra and caused a brilliant light to be born, flaring in empty space beyond my outstretched hands. Imagine that I committed this act of blatant, unmistakeable sorcery under the full supervision of James Randi and all skeptical armies. Most people, I think, would be fairly curious as to what was going on.

But now suppose instead that I don’t go on television. I do not wish to share the power, nor the truth behind it. I want to keep my sorcery secret. And yet I also want to cast my spells whenever and wherever I please. I want to cast my brilliant flare of light so that I can read a book on the train—without anyone becoming curious. Is there a spell that stops curiosity?

Yes indeed! Whenever anyone asks “How did you do that?” I just say “Science!”

It’s not a real explanation, so much as a curiosity-stopper. It doesn’t tell you whether the light will brighten or fade, change color in hue or saturation, and it certainly doesn’t tell you how to make a similar light yourself. You don’t actually know anything more than you knew before I said the magic word. But you turn away, satisfied that nothing unusual is going on.

Better yet, the same trick works with a standard light switch.

Flip a switch and a light bulb turns on. Why?

In school, one is taught that the password to the light bulb is “Electricity!” By now, I hope, you’re wary of marking the light bulb “understood” on such a basis. Does saying “Electricity!” let you do calculations that will control your anticipation of experience? There is, at the least, a great deal more to learn.<sup>1</sup>

If you thought the light bulb was scientifically inexplicable, it would seize the entirety of your attention. You would drop whatever else you were doing, and focus on that light bulb.

But what does the phrase “scientifically explicable” mean? It means that someone else knows how the light bulb works. When you are told the light bulb is “scientifically explicable,” you don’t know more than you knew earlier; you don’t know whether the light bulb will brighten or fade. But because someone else knows, it devalues the knowledge in your eyes. You become less curious.

Someone is bound to say, “If the light bulb were unknown to science, you could gain fame and fortune by investigating it.” But I’m not talking about greed. I’m not talking about career ambition. I’m talking about the raw emotion of curiosity—the feeling of being intrigued. Why should your curiosity be diminished because someone else, not you, knows how the light bulb works? Is this not spite? It’s not enough for you to know; other people must also be ignorant, or you won’t be happy?

There are goods that knowledge may serve besides curiosity, such as the social utility of technology. For these instrumental goods, it matters whether some other entity in local space already knows. But for my own curiosity, why should it matter?

Besides, consider the consequences if you permit “Someone else knows the answer” to function as a curiosity-stopper. One day you walk into your living room and see a giant green elephant, seemingly hovering in midair, surrounded by an aura of silver light.

“What the heck?” you say.

And a voice comes from above the elephant, saying,

> [Somebody already knows why this elephant is here.](http://godescalc.wordpress.com/2012/06/24/overlooked-elephant/)

“Oh,” you say, “in that case, never mind,” and walk on to the kitchen.

I don’t know the grand unified theory for this universe’s laws of physics. I also don’t know much about human anatomy with the exception of the brain. I couldn’t point out on my body where my kidneys are, and I can’t recall offhand what my liver does.<sup>2</sup>

Should I, so far as curiosity is concerned, be more intrigued by my ignorance of the ultimate laws of physics, than the fact that I don’t know much about what goes on inside my own body?

If I raised my hands and cast a light spell, you would be intrigued. Should you be any less intrigued by the very fact that I raised my hands? When you raise your arm and wave a hand around, this act of will is coordinated by (among other brain areas) your cerebellum. I bet you don’t know how the cerebellum works. I know a little—though only the gross details, not enough to perform calculations . . . but so what? What does that matter, if you don’t know? Why should there be a double standard of curiosity for sorcery and hand motions?

Look at yourself in the mirror. Do you know what you’re looking at? Do you know what looks out from behind your eyes? Do you know what you are? Some of that answer Science knows, and some of it Science does not. But why should that distinction matter to your curiosity, if you don’t know?

Do you know how your knees work? Do you know how your shoes were made? Do you know why your computer monitor glows? Do you know why water is wet?

The world around you is full of puzzles. Prioritize, if you must. But do not complain that cruel Science has emptied the world of mystery. With reasoning such as that, I could get you to overlook an elephant in your living room.

<sup>1</sup>Physicists should ignore this paragraph and substitute a problem in evolutionary theory, where the substance of the theory is again in calculations that few people know how to perform.

<sup>2</sup>I am not proud of this. Alas, with all the math I need to study, I’m not likely to learn anatomy anytime soon.
