## 我那狂野而鲁莽的青春

人们常说，父母总会做那些他们告诫孩子不要做的事，这也是他们知道哪些事不该做的原因。

很久很久以前，在那不可思议的遥远过去，我曾是一个虔诚的传统理性主义者，自认为在那一套体系下很有本事，但我还不懂贝叶斯之道。当年轻的 Eliezer 遇到一个看似神秘的问题时，传统理性主义的教条并没有阻止他编造一个神秘的答案。这是我人生中最令我尴尬的错误，至今想起来仍会让我不禁皱眉。

我对神秘问题的神秘答案是什么？这个我就不细说了，因为那是个冗长而复杂的故事。我那时还年轻，只是个不懂 Tversky 和 Kahneman 教诲的传统理性主义者。我知道奥卡姆剃刀，但不知道合取谬误。我以为自己可以像科学书里那样，用文学化的复杂思维来思考，却没意识到，只有当每一步都被压倒性地落实时，复杂性才是合理的。如今，我给有志于理性的年轻人最重要的建议之一就是：“不要试图进行长链推理或制定复杂计划。”

只需说这么多：即使在我发明了自己的“答案”之后，这个现象对我来说依然是个谜，依然带着最初那种神秘莫测、难以穿透的色彩。

别误会，那时的 Eliezer 并不愚蠢。年轻的 Eliezer 犯下的所有错误，如今依然被受人尊敬的科学家们在权威期刊上不断重演。要保护他不犯错，需要比传统理性主义教给他的更微妙的技艺。

事实上，年轻的 Eliezer 在误入歧途的过程中，确实认真而细致地遵循了传统理性主义的教诲。

作为传统理性主义者，年轻的 Eliezer 很注意让自己的神秘答案对未来体验做出大胆预测。比如，我预期未来的神经学家会发现神经元在利用量子引力，就像 Roger Penrose 所说的那样。这要求神经元保持一定程度的量子相干性，这是可以去寻找、去验证的。要么你观察到了，要么没有，对吧？

但我的假说并没有做出任何回溯性的预测。按照传统科学的说法，回溯性预测不算数——那又何必去做呢？但对贝叶斯主义者来说，如果一个假说今天相较于“我不知道”没有更高的似然比，那就要问你为什么今天会相信比“我不知道”更复杂的东西。但我那时不懂贝叶斯之道，所以我不会去思考似然比，也不会关注概率密度的集中。我做出了一个可证伪的预测；难道这还不够合法吗？

作为传统理性主义者，年轻的 Eliezer 小心翼翼地避免相信魔法、神秘主义、碳沙文主义或类似的东西。我还自豪地宣称我的神秘答案“只是物理学，和其他物理学一样！”仿佛只要把它叫做量子引力，就能让魔法不再等同于魔法。但我不懂贝叶斯之道，没有看到我的想法在本质上和魔法是同构的。我效忠于物理学，但这并不能拯救我；概率论才不管你效忠于谁。我避开了传统理性主义明令禁止的一切，但剩下的依然是魔法。

毫无疑问，传统理性主义的信念帮我走出了自己挖的坑。如果我不是传统理性主义者，可能早就彻底完蛋了。但传统理性主义依然不足以让我做对。它只是让我犯了不同于它明令禁止的那些错误。

每当我想到年轻的自己在走错路的过程中还小心翼翼地遵循着传统理性主义的规则，就会明白为什么那些自称“理性主义者”的人并没有统治世界。你需要极高极高的理性，才能让它真正帮你做对，而不是只是带你走向新的有趣错误。

传统理性主义被当作一门艺术来教，而不是科学；你会读到著名物理学家的传记，了解他们从生活中学到的教训，然后试着照着做。但你没有经历过他们的人生，而他们想描述的一半，其实是被训练成本能的直觉。

按照传统理性主义的设计，只要我最终能证伪自己的愚蠢想法，并且在理论预测和证伪时对自己诚实，哪怕我为此浪费三十年也没关系。这足以让科学的棘轮前进一格，但对那些浪费三十年人生的人来说未免太残酷了。传统理性主义是一场散步，不是一支舞。它的目标是最终带你走向真理，但沿途给了你太多时间去闻花香。

传统理性主义者可以“同意不同意”。传统理性主义并不认为思考是一门精确的艺术，证据面前只有唯一正确的概率估计。在传统理性主义中，你可以猜测，然后检验你的猜测。但我的经验告诉我，如果你不知道，然后去猜，你最终就会错。

贝叶斯之道同样是一门不精确的艺术，至少我现在的讲述方式如此。这些文章依然只是试图用文字表达那些本该用经验传授的教训。但至少它有底层的数学基础，还有认知心理学关于人类实际思维方式的实验证据。也许，这足以跨越那道极高的门槛，让你真正做对，而不是只是被约束在有趣的新错

## My Wild and Reckless Youth

It is said that parents do all the things they tell their children not to do, which is how they know not to do them.

Long ago, in the unthinkably distant past, I was a devoted Traditional Rationalist, conceiving myself skilled according to that kind, yet I knew not the Way of Bayes. When the young Eliezer was confronted with a mysterious-seeming question, the precepts of Traditional Rationality did not stop him from devising a Mysterious Answer. It is, by far, the most embarrassing mistake I made in my life, and I still wince to think of it.

What was my mysterious answer to a mysterious question? This I will not describe, for it would be a long tale and complicated. I was young, and a mere Traditional Rationalist who knew not the teachings of Tversky and Kahneman. I knew about Occam’s Razor, but not the conjunction fallacy. I thought I could get away with thinking complicated thoughts myself, in the literary style of the complicated thoughts I read in science books, not realizing that correct complexity is only possible when every step is pinned down overwhelmingly. Today, one of the chief pieces of advice I give to aspiring young rationalists is “Do not attempt long chains of reasoning or complicated plans.”

Nothing more than this need be said: even after I invented my “answer,” the phenomenon was still a mystery unto me, and possessed the same quality of wondrous impenetrability that it had at the start.

Make no mistake, that younger Eliezer was not stupid. All the errors of which the young Eliezer was guilty are still being made today by respected scientists in respected journals. It would have taken a subtler skill to protect him than ever he was taught as a Traditional Rationalist.

Indeed, the young Eliezer diligently and painstakingly followed the injunctions of Traditional Rationality in the course of going astray.

As a Traditional Rationalist, the young Eliezer was careful to ensure that his Mysterious Answer made a bold prediction of future experience. Namely, I expected future neurologists to discover that neurons were exploiting quantum gravity, a la Sir Roger Penrose. This required neurons to maintain a certain degree of quantum coherence, which was something you could look for, and find or not find. Either you observe that or you don’t, right?

But my hypothesis made no retrospective predictions. According to Traditional Science, retrospective predictions don’t count—so why bother making them? To a Bayesian, on the other hand, if a hypothesis does not today have a favorable likelihood ratio over “I don’t know,” it raises the question of why you today believe anything more complicated than “I don’t know.” But I knew not the Way of Bayes, so I was not thinking about likelihood ratios or focusing probability density. I had Made a Falsifiable Prediction; was this not the Law?

As a Traditional Rationalist, the young Eliezer was careful not to believe in magic, mysticism, carbon chauvinism, or anything of that sort. I proudly professed of my Mysterious Answer, “It is just physics like all the rest of physics!” As if you could save magic from being a cognitive isomorph of magic, by calling it quantum gravity. But I knew not the Way of Bayes, and did not see the level on which my idea was isomorphic to magic. I gave my allegiance to physics, but this did not save me; what does probability theory know of allegiances? I avoided everything that Traditional Rationality told me was forbidden, but what was left was still magic.

Beyond a doubt, my allegiance to Traditional Rationality helped me get out of the hole I dug myself into. If I hadn’t been a Traditional Rationalist, I would have been completely screwed. But Traditional Rationality still wasn’t enough to get it right. It just led me into different mistakes than the ones it had explicitly forbidden.

When I think about how my younger self very carefully followed the rules of Traditional Rationality in the course of getting the answer wrong, it sheds light on the question of why people who call themselves “rationalists” do not rule the world. You need one whole hell of a lot of rationality before it does anything but lead you into new and interesting mistakes.

Traditional Rationality is taught as an art, rather than a science; you read the biography of famous physicists describing the lessons life taught them, and you try to do what they tell you to do. But you haven’t lived their lives, and half of what they’re trying to describe is an instinct that has been trained into them.

The way Traditional Rationality is designed, it would have been acceptable for me to spend thirty years on my silly idea, so long as I succeeded in falsifying it eventually, and was honest with myself about what my theory predicted, and accepted the disproof when it arrived, et cetera. This is enough to let the Ratchet of Science click forward, but it’s a little harsh on the people who waste thirty years of their lives. Traditional Rationality is a walk, not a dance. It’s designed to get you to the truth eventually, and gives you all too much time to smell the flowers along the way.

Traditional Rationalists can agree to disagree. Traditional Rationality doesn’t have the ideal that thinking is an exact art in which there is only one correct probability estimate given the evidence. In Traditional Rationality, you’re allowed to guess, and then test your guess. But experience has taught me that if you don’t know, and you guess, you’ll end up being wrong.

The Way of Bayes is also an imprecise art, at least the way I’m holding forth upon it. These essays are still fumbling attempts to put into words lessons that would be better taught by experience. But at least there’s underlying math, plus experimental evidence from cognitive psychology on how humans actually think. Maybe that will be enough to cross the stratospherically high threshold required for a discipline that lets you actually get it right, instead of just constraining you into interesting new mistakes.
