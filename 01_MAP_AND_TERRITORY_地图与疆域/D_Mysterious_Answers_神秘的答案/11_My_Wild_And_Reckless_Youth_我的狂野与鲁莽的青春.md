## 我的狂野与鲁莽的青春

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

人们常说，父母做了他们告诉孩子不要做的所有事情，这正是他们知道为什么不该做的原因。

很久以前，在那个不可思议遥远的过去，我是一个忠实的传统理性主义者，认为自己是按照那种方式培养的，但我并不懂得贝叶斯的道理。当年轻的埃利泽面对一个看似神秘的问题时，传统理性主义的教义并没有阻止我提出一个神秘的答案。这是我一生中最尴尬的错误，至今我想起来还会觉得不自在。

我的神秘答案是什么呢？我不会描述，因为那是一个漫长且复杂的故事。我年轻，还是一个只知道传统理性主义的理性主义者，根本不懂特弗斯基和卡尼曼的教义。我知道奥卡姆剃刀法则，但不懂联合谬误。我以为自己可以像读到的那些复杂的科学思想那样，自己也能做出复杂的推理，未意识到正确的复杂性只有在每一步都被极其精准地固定下来的时候才能实现。今天，我给年轻理性主义者的主要建议之一是：“不要尝试长链推理或复杂的计划。”

无需多说：即便我发明了我的“答案”，这个现象对我来说仍然是个谜，且拥有最初时的那种奇妙的难解特质。

别误会，年轻的埃利泽并不傻。年轻埃利泽所犯的所有错误，今天仍然是受人尊敬的科学家们在尊敬的期刊中犯的错误。要保护我免于这些错误，比当时传统理性主义所教给我的更为微妙的技巧才行。

事实上，年轻的埃利泽在误入歧途的过程中，勤奋且痛苦地遵循着传统理性主义的教义。

作为一个传统理性主义者，年轻的埃利泽小心翼翼地确保我的神秘答案做出了大胆的未来预测。也就是说，我预期未来的神经学家会发现神经元正在利用量子引力，像罗杰·彭罗斯爵士那样。这要求神经元保持一定程度的量子相干性，这是可以观察到的，可以找到或找不到的。要么你观察到，要么你没有观察到，不是吗？

但我的假设没有做出回溯性预测。根据传统科学，回溯性预测并不算数——那为何还要做呢？而对贝叶斯来说，如果一个假设今天没有比“我不知道”更有利的似然比，那么就会引发一个问题：为什么你今天相信比“我不知道”更复杂的东西？但我并不懂得贝叶斯的道理，所以我并没有思考似然比或聚焦概率密度。我做了一个可以证伪的预测；难道这不是法则吗？

作为一个传统理性主义者，年轻的埃利泽小心翼翼地避免相信魔法、神秘主义、碳沙文主义或任何类似的东西。我自豪地宣称我的神秘答案，“它不过是像其他所有物理学那样的物理学！”好像你可以通过称其为量子引力，来把魔法从魔法的认知同构中拯救出来。但是我并不懂得贝叶斯的道理，没看到我的想法与魔法的同构。我将我的忠诚献给了物理学，但这并没有救我；概率论又岂会在乎忠诚？我避免了传统理性主义告诉我应当避免的所有东西，但剩下的还是魔法。

毫无疑问，我对传统理性主义的忠诚帮我从我自己挖的坑里爬了出来。如果我不是一个传统理性主义者，我早就完蛋了。但传统理性主义仍然不足以让我做对。它只是让我走进了与它明确禁止的错误不同的错误。

当我想到年轻的自己在走错路的过程中，依然小心翼翼地遵循传统理性主义的规则时，我恍若领悟了为什么那些自称为“理性主义者”的人并不主宰世界。你需要大量的理性，才能做到不只是带着你走向新的、有趣的错误。

传统理性主义作为一种艺术而非科学来教授；你读着那些著名物理学家的传记，描述生活教给他们的教训，然后你试着做他们告诉你做的事。但你并没有过他们的生活，而他们所试图描述的一半是已被训练成的直觉。

传统理性主义的设计是这样的：只要我最终成功地证伪了我的愚蠢想法，诚实地面对我的理论预测，并且在反驳到来时接受它等等，我就能在三十年后得出结论。这样一来，科学的拨轮就能继续前进，但这对那些浪费了三十年的人来说有点过于严苛。传统理性主义是一场漫步，而不是舞蹈。它旨在最终带你走向真理，给你足够多的时间去闻闻沿途的花香。

传统理性主义者可以同意不同意见。传统理性主义并没有理想化思考是一个精确的艺术，只有一个给定证据下的正确概率估计。在传统理性主义中，你被允许猜测，然后测试你的猜测。但经验告诉我，如果你不知道，而你去猜测，你最终会错。

贝叶斯之道也是一种不精确的艺术，至少以我目前所持的方式来说。这些文章仍然是在试图把通过经验更好教会的教训用言辞表达出来的笨拙尝试。但至少它有基本的数学支持，此外还有来自认知心理学的实验证据，告诉我们人类是如何思考的。也许这足以跨越那个需要极高门槛的领域，跨越那个让你真正做对的标准，而不仅仅是约束你走向新且有趣的错误。

## My Wild and Reckless Youth

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

It is said that parents do all the things they tell their children not to do, which is how they know not to do them.

Long ago, in the unthinkably distant past, I was a devoted Traditional Rationalist, conceiving myself skilled according to that kind, yet I knew not the Way of Bayes. When the young Eliezer was confronted with a mysterious-seeming question, the precepts of Traditional Rationality did not stop him from devising a Mysterious Answer. It is, by far, the most embarrassing mistake I made in my life, and I still wince to think of it.

What was my mysterious answer to a mysterious question? This I will not describe, for it would be a long tale and complicated. I was young, and a mere Traditional Rationalist who knew not the teachings of Tversky and Kahneman. I knew about Occam’s Razor, but not the conjunction fallacy. I thought I could get away with thinking complicated thoughts myself, in the literary style of the complicated thoughts I read in science books, not realizing that correct complexity is only possible when every step is pinned down overwhelmingly. Today, one of the chief pieces of advice I give to aspiring young rationalists is “Do not attempt long chains of reasoning or complicated plans.”

Nothing more than this need be said: even after I invented my “answer,” the phenomenon was still a mystery unto me, and possessed the same quality of wondrous impenetrability that it had at the start.

Make no mistake, that younger Eliezer was not stupid. All the errors of which the young Eliezer was guilty are still being made today by respected scientists in respected journals. It would have taken a subtler skill to protect him than ever he was taught as a Traditional Rationalist.

Indeed, the young Eliezer diligently and painstakingly followed the injunctions of Traditional Rationality in the course of going astray.

As a Traditional Rationalist, the young Eliezer was careful to ensure that his Mysterious Answer made a bold prediction of future experience. Namely, I expected future neurologists to discover that neurons were exploiting quantum gravity, a la Sir Roger Penrose. This required neurons to maintain a certain degree of quantum coherence, which was something you could look for, and find or not find. Either you observe that or you don’t, right?

But my hypothesis made no retrospective predictions. According to Traditional Science, retrospective predictions don’t count—so why bother making them? To a Bayesian, on the other hand, if a hypothesis does not today have a favorable likelihood ratio over “I don’t know,” it raises the question of why you today believe anything more complicated than “I don’t know.” But I knew not the Way of Bayes, so I was not thinking about likelihood ratios or focusing probability density. I had Made a Falsifiable Prediction; was this not the Law?

As a Traditional Rationalist, the young Eliezer was careful not to believe in magic, mysticism, carbon chauvinism, or anything of that sort. I proudly professed of my Mysterious Answer, “It is just physics like all the rest of physics!” As if you could save magic from being a cognitive isomorph of magic, by calling it quantum gravity. But I knew not the Way of Bayes, and did not see the level on which my idea was isomorphic to magic. I gave my allegiance to physics, but this did not save me; what does probability theory know of allegiances? I avoided everything that Traditional Rationality told me was forbidden, but what was left was still magic.

Beyond a doubt, my allegiance to Traditional Rationality helped me get out of the hole I dug myself into. If I hadn’t been a Traditional Rationalist, I would have been completely screwed. But Traditional Rationality still wasn’t enough to get it right. It just led me into different mistakes than the ones it had explicitly forbidden.

When I think about how my younger self very carefully followed the rules of Traditional Rationality in the course of getting the answer wrong, it sheds light on the question of why people who call themselves “rationalists” do not rule the world. You need one whole hell of a lot of rationality before it does anything but lead you into new and interesting mistakes.

Traditional Rationality is taught as an art, rather than a science; you read the biography of famous physicists describing the lessons life taught them, and you try to do what they tell you to do. But you haven’t lived their lives, and half of what they’re trying to describe is an instinct that has been trained into them.

The way Traditional Rationality is designed, it would have been acceptable for me to spend thirty years on my silly idea, so long as I succeeded in falsifying it eventually, and was honest with myself about what my theory predicted, and accepted the disproof when it arrived, et cetera. This is enough to let the Ratchet of Science click forward, but it’s a little harsh on the people who waste thirty years of their lives. Traditional Rationality is a walk, not a dance. It’s designed to get you to the truth eventually, and gives you all too much time to smell the flowers along the way.

Traditional Rationalists can agree to disagree. Traditional Rationality doesn’t have the ideal that thinking is an exact art in which there is only one correct probability estimate given the evidence. In Traditional Rationality, you’re allowed to guess, and then test your guess. But experience has taught me that if you don’t know, and you guess, you’ll end up being wrong.

The Way of Bayes is also an imprecise art, at least the way I’m holding forth upon it. These essays are still fumbling attempts to put into words lessons that would be better taught by experience. But at least there’s underlying math, plus experimental evidence from cognitive psychology on how humans actually think. Maybe that will be enough to cross the stratospherically high threshold required for a discipline that lets you actually get it right, instead of just constraining you into interesting new mistakes.
