## 未能从历史中吸取教训

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

曾几何时，在我那鲁莽的青春时期，当时我还不懂得贝叶斯之道，我给了一个神秘的答案来回答一个看似神秘的问题。接连发生了许多失败，但其中有一个错误最为关键：年轻的我并没有意识到，解决一个谜题应该让它变得不那么令人困惑。我试图解释一个神秘现象——对我来说，这意味着给它找到一个原因，将它融入一个完整的现实模型中。为什么这会让现象变得不那么神秘呢，难道这不是现象的本质吗？我试图解释这个神秘现象，而不是将它（通过某种不可能的炼金术）变成一个普通的现象，一个根本不需要特殊解释的现象。

作为一个传统理性主义者，我知道占星术和天文学、炼金术和化学、生命力学和生物学的历史故事。但这个神秘现象不同于这些。它是全新的，是更奇怪的，是更困难的，是普通科学几个世纪以来都未能解释的现象——

——就好像星星、物质和生命在几百年、几千年间一直是谜一样，从人类思维的曙光直到科学最终解开它们的谜团——

我们在学校学习天文学、化学和生物学，这让我们觉得这些问题一直是科学的领域，它们从未是神秘的。当科学敢于挑战一个新的伟大难题时，那一代的孩子们持怀疑态度，因为他们从未见过科学解释一个他们觉得神秘的东西。科学只擅长解释科学主题，比如星星、物质和生命。

我曾认为，历史的教训是，占星家、炼金术士和生命力主义者有一种与生俱来的缺陷，一种神秘主义的倾向，导致他们为非神秘的事物提供神秘的解释。但如果一个现象真的很奇怪，难道应该用一个奇怪的解释来解释吗？

直到后来，当我开始看到神秘之中隐藏的普通结构时，我才意识到我站在什么位置。只有到那时，我才意识到生命力主义在当时看起来是多么合理，宇宙的回答“生命是普通的，不需要一个奇怪的解释”是多么令人惊讶和尴尬。

我们读历史，但我们并没有亲身经历它，我们没有真正感受到它。如果当时我亲自假设了占星学的谜题，然后发现了牛顿力学，假设了炼金术的谜题，然后发现了化学，假设了生命力学的谜题，然后发现了生物学。我一定会想到我的神秘答案，并对自己说：这次我绝不会再上当了。

## Failing to Learn from History

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Once upon a time, in my reckless youth, when I knew not the Way of Bayes, I gave a Mysterious Answer to a mysterious-seeming question. Many failures occurred in sequence, but one mistake stands out as most critical: My younger self did not realize that solving a mystery should make it feel less confusing. I was trying to explain a Mysterious Phenomenon—which to me meant providing a cause for it, fitting it into an integrated model of reality. Why should this make the phenomenon less Mysterious, when that is its nature? I was trying to explain the Mysterious Phenomenon, not render it (by some impossible alchemy) into a mundane phenomenon, a phenomenon that wouldn’t even call out for an unusual explanation in the first place.

As a Traditional Rationalist, I knew the historical tales of astrologers and astronomy, of alchemists and chemistry, of vitalists and biology. But the Mysterious Phenomenon was not like this. It was something new, something stranger, something more difficult, something that ordinary science had failed to explain for centuries—

—as if stars and matter and life had not been mysteries for hundreds of years and thousands of years, from the dawn of human thought right up until science finally solved them—

We learn about astronomy and chemistry and biology in school, and it seems to us that these matters have always been the proper realm of science, that they have never been mysterious. When science dares to challenge a new Great Puzzle, the children of that generation are skeptical, for they have never seen science explain something that feels mysterious to them. Science is only good for explaining scientific subjects, like stars and matter and life.

I thought the lesson of history was that astrologers and alchemists and vitalists had an innate character flaw, a tendency toward mysterianism, which led them to come up with mysterious explanations for non-mysterious subjects. But surely, if a phenomenon really was very weird, a weird explanation might be in order?

It was only afterward, when I began to see the mundane structure inside the mystery, that I realized whose shoes I was standing in. Only then did I realize how reasonable vitalism had seemed at the time, how surprising and embarrassing had been the universe’s reply of, “Life is mundane, and does not need a weird explanation.”

We read history but we don’t live it, we don’t experience it. If only I had personally postulated astrological mysteries and then discovered Newtonian mechanics, postulated alchemical mysteries and then discovered chemistry, postulated vitalistic mysteries and then discovered biology. I would have thought of my Mysterious Answer and said to myself: No way am I falling for that again.
