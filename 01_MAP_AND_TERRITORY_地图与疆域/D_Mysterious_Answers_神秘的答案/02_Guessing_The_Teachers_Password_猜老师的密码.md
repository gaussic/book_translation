## 猜老师的密码

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

小时候，我读过一些通俗物理书，比如费曼的《QED：光与物质的奇特理论》。我知道光是波，声音是波，物质也是波。九岁时，我为自己的科学素养感到自豪。

后来我年纪大些，开始读《费曼物理学讲义》，遇到了一个叫“波动方程”的宝贝。我能跟着推导过程走，但[回头看](http://www.math.utah.edu/~pa/math/polya.html)，我并不能一眼看出它的真理性。于是我断断续续地思考了三天，直到发现它其实尴尬地显而易见。当我终于理解时，我意识到，原来我一直以来都只是接受了物理学家们的诚实保证——光是波，声音是波，物质是波——但我其实根本不知道“波”在物理学家那里意味着什么。

人有一种本能的倾向，认为如果物理学家说“光是由波组成的”，老师问“光是什么做的？”，学生答“波！”，那学生就说对了。这很公平，对吧？我们接受物理学家的“波”作为正确答案，难道拒绝学生的“波”不太公平吗？“波！”这个答案不是非真即假吗？

这又是一个需要[从学校里忘掉的坏习惯](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i2/two_more_things_to_unlearn_from_school/)。词语本身没有内在定义。如果我听到“bea-ver”这个音节并想到一种大型啮齿动物，那只是我头脑里的事实，而不是“bea-ver”这串音节本身的事实。“由波组成”（或“因为热传导”）这串音节本身不是假说，只是一串空气中的振动或纸上的墨迹。它可以在某人脑中关联到某个假说，但它本身并非对错。但在学校里，老师会因为你说“由波组成”而给你一颗金星，因为老师听过物理学家发出同样的声音。既然口头或书面表达能换来金星，学生们就开始以为口头表达本身有真假。毕竟，光要么是波做的，要么不是，对吧？

这又导致了更糟糕的习惯。假设老师问你，为什么金属板远离暖气片的一侧比靠近暖气片的一侧更热。如果你说“我不知道”，你根本拿不到金星，连课堂参与都不算。但这个学期老师用过“因为热对流”“因为热传导”“因为辐射热”这些短语，其中一个大概就是老师想要的。你说：“呃，也许是因为热传导？”

这不是关于金属板的假说，甚至算不上真正的信念。这只是试图猜老师的密码。

即使你脑中浮现出扩散方程（描述热传导的数学公式）的符号，也不代表你对金属板形成了假说。这不是学校，我们不是在考你能不能写出扩散方程。这是贝叶斯技艺，我们考察的是你对经验的预期。如果你用扩散方程，测量几个点的温度，然后试着预测下一个测量点的温度，那这就确实和经验相关。哪怕学生只是脑中想象有东西在流动，于是把火柴靠近较凉的一侧，试着测量热量流向哪里，这种“流动感”的心象也和经验相关，它能控制你的预期。

如果你没有用扩散方程——没有带入数字、得出能控制你对具体体验预期的结果——那地图和疆域的联系就像被刀切断了一样。剩下的不是信念，而只是口头表达。

在学校体系里，一切都围绕口头表达，无论是写在纸上还是说出口。口头表达能让你得金星或不及格。要摆脱这个坏习惯，必须有意识地区分“解释”和“密码”。

你觉得这样太苛刻了吗？面对让人困惑的金属板时，“热传导？”难道不能作为寻找答案的第一步？也许可以，但前提是你别陷入“我在找密码”的陷阱。如果没有老师告诉你你错了，你可能会觉得“光是 wakalixes”是个好解释，“wakalixes”就是正确密码。我九岁时就遇到过这种情况——不是因为我笨，而是因为人类默认就会这样想。除非经过训练，否则人类就是这样思考的。人类在这种坑里卡了几千年。

也许，如果我们反复训练学生“词语不算，只有能控制预期的东西才算”，学生就不会卡在“热传导？不对？也许热对流？也不是？”这种循环里。也许那时，“热传导”这个短语会引导他们走上一条真正有用的道路，比如：

- “热传导？”
- 但那只是个短语——它是什么意思？
- 扩散方程？
- 但那只是些符号——我该怎么用它们？
- 应用扩散方程会让我预期什么？
- 它肯定不会让我预期金属板远离暖气片的一侧会更热。
- 我发现自己很困惑。也许靠近暖气片的一侧只是感觉更凉，因为它的材料更绝热，传递给我手的热量更少？我试着测一下温度……
- 好吧，不是这样。我能不能验证扩散方程对这块金属板是否成立？热量是不是像通常那样流动，还是有别的情况？
- 我可以用火柴靠近金属板，试着测量热量随时间的扩散……

如果我们不严格把“呃，也许是因为热传导？”当作虚假解释，学生很可能会卡在某个 wakalixes-密码上。这是默认结果：整个人类曾因此卡了几千年。

## Guessing the Teacher’s Password

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

When I was young, I read popular physics books such as Richard Feynman’s QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter. I knew that light was waves, sound was waves, matter was waves. I took pride in my scientific literacy, when I was nine years old.

When I was older, and I began to read the Feynman Lectures on Physics, I ran across a gem called “the wave equation.” I could follow the equation’s derivation, but, [looking back](http://www.math.utah.edu/~pa/math/polya.html), I couldn’t see its truth at a glance. So I thought about the wave equation for three days, on and off, until I saw that it was embarrassingly obvious. And when I finally understood, I realized that the whole time I had accepted the honest assurance of physicists that light was waves, sound was waves, matter was waves, I had not had the vaguest idea of what the word “wave” meant to a physicist.

There is an instinctive tendency to think that if a physicist says “light is made of waves,” and the teacher says “What is light made of?” and the student says “Waves!”, then the student has made a true statement. That’s only fair, right? We accept “waves” as a correct answer from the physicist; wouldn’t it be unfair to reject it from the student? Surely, the answer “Waves!” is either true or false, right?

Which is one more bad habit to [unlearn from school](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i2/two_more_things_to_unlearn_from_school/). Words do not have intrinsic definitions. If I hear the syllables “bea-ver” and think of a large rodent, that is a fact about my own state of mind, not a fact about the syllables “bea-ver.” The sequence of syllables “made of waves” (or “because of heat conduction”) is not a hypothesis; it is a pattern of vibrations traveling through the air, or ink on paper. It can associate to a hypothesis in someone’s mind, but it is not, of itself, right or wrong. But in school, the teacher hands you a gold star for saying “made of waves,” which must be the correct answer because the teacher heard a physicist emit the same sound-vibrations. Since verbal behavior (spoken or written) is what gets the gold star, students begin to think that verbal behavior has a truth-value. After all, either light is made of waves, or it isn’t, right?

And this leads into an even worse habit. Suppose the teacher asks you why the far side of a metal plate feels warmer than the side next to the radiator. If you say “I don’t know,” you have no chance of getting a gold star—it won’t even count as class participation. But, during the current semester, this teacher has used the phrases “because of heat convection,” “because of heat conduction,” and “because of radiant heat.” One of these is probably what the teacher wants. You say, “Eh, maybe because of heat conduction?”

This is not a hypothesis about the metal plate. This is not even a proper belief. It is an attempt to guess the teacher’s password.

Even visualizing the symbols of the diffusion equation (the math governing heat conduction) doesn’t mean you’ve formed a hypothesis about the metal plate. This is not school; we are not testing your memory to see if you can write down the diffusion equation. This is Bayescraft; we are scoring your anticipations of experience. If you use the diffusion equation, by measuring a few points with a thermometer and then trying to predict what the thermometer will say on the next measurement, then it is definitely connected to experience. Even if the student just visualizes something flowing, and therefore holds a match near the cooler side of the plate to try to measure where the heat goes, then this mental image of flowing-ness connects to experience; it controls anticipation.

If you aren’t using the diffusion equation—putting in numbers and getting out results that control your anticipation of particular experiences—then the connection between map and territory is severed as though by a knife. What remains is not a belief, but a verbal behavior.

In the school system, it’s all about verbal behavior, whether written on paper or spoken aloud. Verbal behavior gets you a gold star or a failing grade. Part of unlearning this bad habit is becoming consciously aware of the difference between an explanation and a password.

Does this seem too harsh? When you’re faced by a confusing metal plate, can’t “heat conduction?” be a first step toward finding the answer? Maybe, but only if you don’t fall into the trap of thinking that you are looking for a password. What if there is no teacher to tell you that you failed? Then you may think that “Light is wakalixes” is a good explanation, that “wakalixes” is the correct password. It happened to me when I was nine years old—not because I was stupid, but because this is what happens by default. This is how human beings think, unless they are trained not to fall into the trap. Humanity stayed stuck in holes like this for thousands of years.

Maybe, if we drill students that words don’t count, only anticipation-controllers, the student will not get stuck on “Heat conduction? No? Maybe heat convection? That’s not it either?” Maybe then, thinking the phrase “heat conduction” will lead onto a genuinely helpful path, like:

- “Heat conduction?”
- But that’s only a phrase—what does it mean?
- The diffusion equation?
- But those are only symbols—how do I apply them?
- What does applying the diffusion equation lead me to anticipate?
- It sure doesn’t lead me to anticipate that the side of a metal plate farther away from a radiator would feel warmer.
- I notice that I am confused. Maybe the near side just feels cooler, because it’s made of more insulative material and transfers less heat to my hand? I’ll try measuring the temperature . . .
- Okay, that wasn’t it. Can I try to verify whether the diffusion equation holds true of this metal plate, at all? Is heat flowing the way it usually does, or is something else going on?
- I could hold a match to the plate and try to measure how heat spreads over time . . .

If we are not strict about “Eh, maybe because of heat conduction?” being a fake explanation, the student will very probably get stuck on some wakalixes-password. This happens by default: it happened to the whole human species for thousands of years.
