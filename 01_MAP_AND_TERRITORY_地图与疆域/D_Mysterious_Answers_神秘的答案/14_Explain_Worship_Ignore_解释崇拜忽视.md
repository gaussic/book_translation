## 解释/崇拜/忽视？

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

当我们的部落在草原上游荡，寻找果树和猎物时，偶尔会有水从天而降。

“为什么有时候水会从天上落下来？”我问部落中的智者，他胡须花白。

他思索片刻，这个问题他从未考虑过，然后说道：“有时，天上的精灵会发生战斗，当他们打斗时，他们的血就会滴落到地面。”

“天上的精灵从哪里来？”我继续问。

他的声音变得低沉：“来自远古时代。来自很久很久以前。”

当下雨时，你不知道为什么会下雨，你有几个选择。首先，你可以选择不问为什么——不去追问问题，或者根本不去想这个问题。这就是“忽视”命令，智者最初选择的方式。第二，你可以尝试给出某种解释，选择“解释”命令，就像智者在面对你第一个问题时所做的那样。第三，你可以享受那种神秘感——选择“崇拜”命令。

现在，正如你从这个故事中会注意到的，每当你选择“解释”时，最好的结果是得到一个解释，比如“天上的精灵”。但这个解释本身也面临着同样的困境——解释、崇拜还是忽视？每次你点击“解释”，科学就会进行一段时间，给出一个解释，然后又会弹出另一个对话框。作为理性主义者，我们觉得有责任不断点击“解释”，但这似乎是一个没有尽头的道路。

你点击“解释”去了解生命，得到的是化学；你点击“解释”去了解化学，得到的是原子；你点击“解释”去了解原子，得到的是电子和原子核；你点击“解释”去了解原子核，得到的是量子色动力学和夸克；你点击“解释”去了解夸克的起源，最终你得到的是“大爆炸”……

我们可以点击“解释”去了解大爆炸，然后等着科学继续推进，或许有一天它会给出一个完全合理的解释。但那时又会弹出另一个对话框。所以，如果我们一直继续下去，最终我们会遇到一个特殊的对话框，一个新的选项，一个“无需解释的解释”，一个链条结束的地方——或许，这就是唯一值得知道的解释。

就在这里——我刚刚选择了“崇拜”。

永远不要忘记，崇拜某样东西的方式远不止在祭坛上点燃蜡烛。

如果我当时说：“嗯，这确实看起来像是个悖论。我想知道这个悖论是怎么解决的？”那么我就会选择“解释”，而这确实有时需要一些时间才能给出答案。

如果这个问题对你来说似乎不重要，或者无关紧要，或者你更愿意把它放到明天再想，那么你就选择了“忽视”。

请明智地选择你的选项。

## Explain/Worship/Ignore?

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

As our tribe wanders through the grasslands, searching for fruit trees and prey, it happens every now and then that water pours down from the sky.

“Why does water sometimes fall from the sky?” I ask the bearded wise man of our tribe.

He thinks for a moment, this question having never occurred to him before, and then says, “From time to time, the sky spirits battle, and when they do, their blood drips from the sky.”

“Where do the sky spirits come from?” I ask.

His voice drops to a whisper. “From the before time. From the long long ago.”

When it rains, and you don’t know why, you have several options. First, you could simply not ask why—not follow up on the question, or never think of the question in the first place. This is the Ignore command, which the bearded wise man originally selected. Second, you could try to devise some sort of explanation, the Explain command, as the bearded man did in response to your first question. Third, you could enjoy the sensation of mysteriousness—the Worship command.

Now, as you are bound to notice from this story, each time you select Explain, the best-case scenario is that you get an explanation, such as “sky spirits.” But then this explanation itself is subject to the same dilemma—Explain, Worship, or Ignore? Each time you hit Explain, science grinds for a while, returns an explanation, and then another dialog box pops up. As good rationalists, we feel duty-bound to keep hitting Explain, but it seems like a road that has no end.

You hit Explain for life, and get chemistry; you hit Explain for chemistry, and get atoms; you hit Explain for atoms, and get electrons and nuclei; you hit Explain for nuclei, and get quantum chromodynamics and quarks; you hit Explain for how the quarks got there, and get back the Big Bang . . .

We can hit Explain for the Big Bang, and wait while science grinds through its process, and maybe someday it will return a perfectly good explanation. But then that will just bring up another dialog box. So, if we continue long enough, we must come to a special dialog box, a new option, an Explanation That Needs No Explanation, a place where the chain ends—and this, maybe, is the only explanation worth knowing.

There—I just hit Worship.

Never forget that there are many more ways to worship something than lighting candles around an altar.

If I’d said, “Huh, that does seem paradoxical. I wonder how the apparent paradox is resolved?” then I would have hit Explain, which does sometimes take a while to produce an answer.

And if the whole issue seems to you unimportant, or irrelevant, or if you’d rather put off thinking about it until tomorrow, than you have hit Ignore.

Select your option wisely.
