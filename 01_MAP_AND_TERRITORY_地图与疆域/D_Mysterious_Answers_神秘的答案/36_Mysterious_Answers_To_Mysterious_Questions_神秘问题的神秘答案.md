## 神秘问题的神秘答案

想象你看着自己的手，对细胞一无所知，对生物化学一无所知，对DNA也一无所知。你通过解剖学学到了一些肌肉知识，所以你知道手里有肌肉；但你不知道为什么肌肉会动，而不是像黏土一样静静地躺着。你的手只是……某种物质……但出于某种原因，它会按照你的意愿运动。这难道不是魔法吗？

> “在我看来，现在依然如此，动物身体并不像热力学引擎那样运作……动植物对物质的影响，远远超出了迄今为止任何科学探究的范围。它们能够引导运动粒子的运动，这种能力在我们人类自由意志的日常奇迹中，以及一代又一代植物从一粒种子生长出来的过程中，都与原子偶然聚合的任何可能结果有着天壤之别。”<sup>1</sup>
> “意识让每个人都知道，他们在某种程度上受自己的意志支配。因此，有生命的生物能够直接对体内某些运动粒子施加力量，从而使这些粒子的运动被引导去产生期望的机械效果。”<sup>2</sup>
> “现代生物学家再次坚定地接受了某种超越单纯引力、化学和物理力的东西；而这种未知的东西，就是生命原理。”<sup>3</sup>
> ——开尔文勋爵

这就是“活力论”理论：认为活物和非活物之间神秘的差异，是由一种“生命力”（élan vital 或 vis vitalis）解释的。生命力注入活物，使其能按照意识的指令运动。生命力参与了非活性粒子无法进行的化学转化——后来Wöhler合成了尿素（一种尿液成分），这对活力论是重大打击，因为它证明了单纯的化学反应也能复制生物产物。

把“生命力”称为一种解释，甚至说它是像燃素那样的伪解释，可能都太抬举它了。它的主要作用其实是好奇心终止符。你问“为什么？”，答案就是“生命力！”

当你说“生命力！”时，你会觉得自己知道了手为什么会动。你脑中有一个小小的因果图：

    生命力！ -----> 手会动

但实际上，你并没有比之前知道得更多。比如，你并不知道你的手会产生热量还是吸收热量，除非你已经观察过这个事实；否则你无法提前预测。你的好奇心得到了满足的感觉，但其实并没有被真正喂养。因为你可以对任何可能的观察都说“为什么？生命力！”，所以它对所有结果的解释能力是一样的，本质上是伪装成解释的最大熵假说，等等。但更深刻的教训在于，活力论者对“生命力”的崇敬，他们急于把它宣布为超越一切科学的神秘。当面对“未知”这条巨龙时，活力论者没有拔剑迎战，而是低头臣服。他们以自己的无知为傲，把生物学变成神圣的谜团，因此当证据出现时，他们也不愿放弃自己的无知。

生命的奥秘远远超出了科学的触及！不是稍微超出一点，而是无限超出！开尔文勋爵显然对自己不知道某件事感到极大的情感满足。

但无知存在于地图中，而不是领地中。如果我对某个现象无知，那只是我自己心智状态的事实，而不是这个现象本身的事实。某个现象对某个人来说可以是神秘的，但没有哪种现象本身就是神秘的。崇拜某个现象，仅仅因为它看起来如此神秘，其实是在崇拜自己的无知。

活力论和燃素理论一样，都犯了把谜团封装成某种“物质”的错误。火是神秘的，燃素理论就把谜团封装进一种叫“燃素”的神秘物质里。生命是神圣的谜团，活力论就把神圣的谜团封装进一种叫“生命力”的神秘物质里。这两种“答案”都没有帮助模型集中概率密度——没有让某些结果比其他结果更容易解释。这种“解释”只是把问题包裹成一个小而坚硬、不透明的黑球。

莫里哀的一部喜剧里，一位医生解释安眠药的作用时说，它含有“催眠效力”。同样的原理。这是人类心理的失败：面对神秘现象时，我们更容易假设有神秘的内在物质，而不是复杂的底层过程。

但更深层的失败，是以为答案本身可以是神秘的。如果一个现象让人觉得神秘，那只是我们知识状态的事实，而不是现象本身的事实。活力论者看到自己知识中的神秘空白，就假设有种神秘的东西来填补这个空白。这样做，他们混淆了地图和领地。所有的困惑和迷惑都存在于头脑中，而不是被封装进某种物质里。

这就是为什么在人类历史上，人们一次又一次地惊讶地发现，极其神秘的问题其实有一个并不神秘的答案。神秘是问题的属性，而不是答案的属性。

因此，我把活力论这类理论称为“神秘问题的神秘答案”。

神秘问题的神秘答案有以下特征：
- 首先，这种“解释”起到的是好奇心终止符的作用，而不是预期控制器。
- 其次，这个假说没有“活动部件”——模型不是具体复杂的机制，而是一个空洞的实体或力量。神秘的物质或力量可以说在这里或那里，能导致这个或那个，但为什么它会这样表现则被包裹在一个空白的整体里。
- 第三，提出这种解释的人以自己的无知为傲；他们自豪地宣称这个现象击败了普通科学，或与世俗现象完全不同。
- 第四，即使给出了答案，这个现象依然是个谜，依然保留着最初那种不可思议的神

## Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions

Imagine looking at your hand, and knowing nothing of cells, nothing of biochemistry, nothing of DNA. You’ve learned some anatomy from dissection, so you know your hand contains muscles; but you don’t know why muscles move instead of lying there like clay. Your hand is just . . . stuff . . . and for some reason it moves under your direction. Is this not magic?

It seemed to me then, and it still seems to me, most probable that the animal body does not act as a thermodynamic engine . . . The influence of animal or vegetable life on matter is infinitely beyond the range of any scientific inquiry hitherto entered on. Its power of directing the motions of moving particles, in the demonstrated daily miracle of our human free-will, and in the growth of generation after generation of plants from a single seed, are infinitely different from any possible result of the fortuitous concourse of atoms[.]<sup>1</sup>

[C]onsciousness teaches every individual that they are, to some extent, subject to the direction of his will. It appears, therefore, that animated creatures have the power of immediately applying, to certain moving particles of matter within their bodies, forces by which the motions of these particles are directed to produce desired mechanical effects.<sup>2</sup>

Modern biologists are coming once more to a firm acceptance of something beyond mere gravitational, chemical, and physical forces; and that unknown thing is a vital principle.3
	
—Lord Kelvin

This was the theory of vitalism; that the mysterious difference between living matter and non-living matter was explained by an élan vital or vis vitalis. Élan vital infused living matter and caused it to move as consciously directed. Élan vital participated in chemical transformations which no mere non-living particles could undergo—Wöhler’s later synthesis of urea, a component of urine, was a major blow to the vitalistic theory because it showed that mere chemistry could duplicate a product of biology.

Calling “élan vital” an explanation, even a fake explanation like phlogiston, is probably giving it too much credit. It functioned primarily as a curiosity-stopper. You said “Why?” and the answer was “Élan vital!”

When you say “Élan vital!” it feels like you know why your hand moves. You have a little causal diagram in your head that says:

	Élan Vital! -----> Hand Moves

But actually you know nothing you didn’t know before. You don’t know, say, whether your hand will generate heat or absorb heat, unless you have observed the fact already; if not, you won’t be able to predict it in advance. Your curiosity feels sated, but it hasn’t been fed. Since you can say “Why? Élan vital!” to any possible observation, it is equally good at explaining all outcomes, a disguised hypothesis of maximum entropy, et cetera. But the greater lesson lies in the vitalists’ reverence for the élan vital, their eagerness to pronounce it a mystery beyond all science. Meeting the great dragon Unknown, the vitalists did not draw their swords to do battle, but bowed their necks in submission. They took pride in their ignorance, made biology into a sacred mystery, and thereby became loath to relinquish their ignorance when evidence came knocking.

The Secret of Life was infinitely beyond the reach of science! Not just a little beyond, mind you, but infinitely beyond! Lord Kelvin sure did get a tremendous emotional kick out of not knowing something.

But ignorance exists in the map, not in the territory. If I am ignorant about a phenomenon, that is a fact about my own state of mind, not a fact about the phenomenon itself. A phenomenon can seem mysterious to some particular person. There are no phenomena which are mysterious of themselves. To worship a phenomenon because it seems so wonderfully mysterious is to worship your own ignorance.

Vitalism shared with phlogiston the error of encapsulating the mystery as a substance. Fire was mysterious, and the phlogiston theory encapsulated the mystery in a mysterious substance called “phlogiston.” Life was a sacred mystery, and vitalism encapsulated the sacred mystery in a mysterious substance called “élan vital.” Neither answer helped concentrate the model’s probability density—helped make some outcomes easier to explain than others. The “explanation” just wrapped up the question as a small, hard, opaque black ball.

In a comedy written by Moliére, a physician explains the power of a soporific by saying that it contains a “dormitive potency.” Same principle. It is a failure of human psychology that, faced with a mysterious phenomenon, we more readily postulate mysterious inherent substances than complex underlying processes.

But the deeper failure is supposing that an answer can be mysterious. If a phenomenon feels mysterious, that is a fact about our state of knowledge, not a fact about the phenomenon itself. The vitalists saw a mysterious gap in their knowledge, and postulated a mysterious stuff that plugged the gap. In doing so, they mixed up the map with the territory. All confusion and bewilderment exist in the mind, not in encapsulated substances.

This is the ultimate and fully general explanation for why, again and again in humanity’s history, people are shocked to discover that an incredibly mysterious question has a non-mysterious answer. Mystery is a property of questions, not answers.

Therefore I call theories such as vitalism mysterious answers to mysterious questions.

These are the signs of mysterious answers to mysterious questions:
- First, the explanation acts as a curiosity-stopper rather than an anticipation-controller.
- Second, the hypothesis has no moving parts—the model is not a specific complex mechanism, but a blankly solid substance or force. The mysterious substance or mysterious force may be said to be here or there, to cause this or that; but the reason why the mysterious force behaves thus is wrapped in a blank unity.
- Third, those who proffer the explanation cherish their ignorance; they speak proudly of how the phenomenon defeats ordinary science or is unlike merely mundane phenomena.
- Fourth, even after the answer is given, the phenomenon is still a mystery and possesses the same quality of wonderful inexplicability that it had at the start.
