## 感受理性

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

既然好奇心是一种情感，我猜有些人会反对把好奇心视为理性的一部分。关于“理性”的一种流行看法是，理性与所有情感对立——我们的悲伤和喜悦仅仅因为是情感，就自动与逻辑相悖。然而奇怪的是，我在概率论中找不到任何定理证明我应该表现得冷若冰霜、毫无表情。

当人们把“情感”和“理性”对立起来时，我怀疑他们其实是在想系统1和系统2——即快速的感知判断与缓慢的深思熟虑判断。系统2的深思熟虑并不总是正确，系统1的感知判断也不总是错误；所以把这种二分法与“理性”区分开来非常重要。两种系统都可以服务于真理的目标，也可以阻碍它，这取决于你如何使用。

就我个人而言，如果一种情感建立在错误信念上，或者说，建立在会导致错误的认知行为上，我就称之为“不理性”的情感。“如果烙铁靠近你的脸，你认为它是烫的，实际上却是凉的，道就反对你的恐惧。如果烙铁靠近你的脸，你认为它是凉的，实际上却是烫的，道就反对你的平静。”反过来，由正确信念或有助于真理的思考引发的情感，就是“理性的情感”；这样我们就可以把平静视为一种情感状态，而不是某种特权的默认状态。

那么理性和感受是正交的吗？不是；我们的情感源自我们对现实的模型。如果我相信死去的兄弟被发现还活着，我会高兴；如果我醒来发现那只是个梦，我会悲伤。P. C. Hodgell 说过：“真理能够摧毁的东西就应该被摧毁。”我梦中的快乐被真理所反对。我醒来后的悲伤是理性的；没有什么真理能摧毁它。

理性始于对“世界是什么样”的提问，但它会像病毒一样扩散到任何依赖于我们对世界看法的思想。你关于“世界是什么样”的信念可以涉及你认为现实中存在的任何事物，无论它是否真的存在，任何属于“能让其他事物发生的东西”这一类的成员。如果你相信壁橱里有个小妖精会把你的鞋带系在一起，这就是关于世界状态的信念。你的鞋是真实的——你可以拿起来。如果有东西能伸手把你的鞋带系在一起，那它也必须是真实的，是我们称为“宇宙”的因果网络的一部分。

对那个把你鞋带系在一起的小妖精感到愤怒，涉及的不仅仅是关于世界状态的心态。假设你是佛教徒、做过脑叶切除手术，或者只是个非常冷静的人，发现鞋带被系在一起也不会生气。这不会影响你对世界的预期——你仍然会预期打开壁橱看到鞋带被系在一起。你的愤怒或平静不应影响你在这里的最佳猜测，因为壁橱里发生的事并不取决于你的情感状态；尽管要想清楚这一点可能需要一些努力。

但愤怒的感觉与关于世界状态的心态纠缠在一起；你之所以生气，是因为你认为小妖精系了你的鞋带。理性的标准会像病毒一样扩散，从最初“小妖精是否系了你的鞋带”的问题，扩展到随之而来的愤怒。

变得更理性——对世界状态有更好的估计——可能会减弱或增强情感。有时我们会通过否认事实、回避引发强烈情感的世界观来逃避强烈的情感。如果是这样，那么当你学习理性技能并训练自己不否认事实时，你的情感会变得更强烈。

在我早年时，我从未确定过强烈地感受某些事物是否合适——是否被允许，是否得体。我认为这种困惑并不仅仅源于我年少时对理性的误解。我在那些甚至不追求成为理性主义者的人身上也观察到类似的困扰；当他们高兴时，会怀疑自己是否真的被允许高兴；当他们悲伤时，也总是不确定是否该逃避这种情感。至少自苏格拉底时代以来，也许更早，表现得有教养和世故的方式就是永远不让别人看到你对任何事物有强烈的在意。表达情感令人尴尬——在礼仪社会中是不该做的。你应该看看当人们发现我有多在乎理性时投来的奇怪目光。我认为这不是因为话题本身奇怪，而是他们不习惯看到理智的成年人会明显地在乎某件事。

但我现在知道，强烈地感受并没有错。自从我采纳了“真理能够摧毁的东西就应该被摧毁”这条准则后，我也意识到“真理能滋养的东西就应该茁壮成长”。当好事发生时，我会高兴，而且我不会怀疑自己高兴是否理性。当[坏事发生](http://yudkowsky.net/other/yehuda/)时，我不会通过寻找虚假的安慰和伪善的希望来逃避我的悲伤。我会想象人类的过去和未来，历史上数百亿的死亡、苦难与恐惧、对答案的追寻、在鲜血中颤抖伸向上方的手、以及有朝一日我们把群星变为城市时的可能——所有的黑暗与光明——我知道我永远无法真正理解这一切，也没有合适的语言表达。尽管我有那么多哲学思考，我仍然羞于坦白自己的强烈情感，你大概听到这些也会觉得不自在。但我现在知道，去感受，是理性的。

## Feeling Rational

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Since curiosity is an emotion, I suspect that some people will object to treating curiosity as a part of rationality. A popular belief about “rationality” is that rationality opposes all emotion—that all our sadness and all our joy are automatically anti-logical by virtue of being feelings. Yet strangely enough, I can’t find any theorem of probability theory which proves that I should appear ice-cold and expressionless.

When people think of “emotion” and “rationality” as opposed, I suspect that they are really thinking of System 1 and System 2—fast perceptual judgments versus slow deliberative judgments. System 2’s deliberative judgments aren’t always true, and System 1’s perceptual judgments aren’t always false; so it is very important to distinguish that dichotomy from “rationality.” Both systems can serve the goal of truth, or defeat it, depending on how they are used.

For my part, I label an emotion as “not rational” if it rests on mistaken beliefs, or rather, on mistake-producing epistemic conduct. “If the iron approaches your face, and you believe it is hot, and it is cool, the Way opposes your fear. If the iron approaches your face, and you believe it is cool, and it is hot, the Way opposes your calm.” Conversely, an emotion that is evoked by correct beliefs or truth-conducive thinking is a “rational emotion”; and this has the advantage of letting us regard calm as an emotional state, rather than a privileged default.

So is rationality orthogonal to feeling? No; our emotions arise from our models of reality. If I believe that my dead brother has been discovered alive, I will be happy; if I wake up and realize it was a dream, I will be sad. P. C. Hodgell said: “That which can be destroyed by the truth should be.” My dreaming self’s happiness was opposed by truth. My sadness on waking is rational; there is no truth which destroys it.

Rationality begins by asking how-the-world-is, but spreads virally to any other thought which depends on how we think the world is. Your beliefs about “how-the-world-is” can concern anything you think is out there in reality, anything that either does or does not exist, any member of the class “things that can make other things happen.” If you believe that there is a goblin in your closet that ties your shoes’ laces together, then this is a belief about how-the-world-is. Your shoes are real—you can pick them up. If there’s something out there that can reach out and tie your shoelaces together, it must be real too, part of the vast web of causes and effects we call the “universe.”

Feeling angry at the goblin who tied your shoelaces involves a state of mind that is not just about how-the-world-is. Suppose that, as a Buddhist or a lobotomy patient or just a very phlegmatic person, finding your shoelaces tied together didn’t make you angry. This wouldn’t affect what you expected to see in the world—you’d still expect to open up your closet and find your shoelaces tied together. Your anger or calm shouldn’t affect your best guess here, because what happens in your closet does not depend on your emotional state of mind; though it may take some effort to think that clearly.

But the angry feeling is tangled up with a state of mind that is about how-the-world-is; you become angry because you think the goblin tied your shoelaces. The criterion of rationality spreads virally, from the initial question of whether or not a goblin tied your shoelaces, to the resulting anger.

Becoming more rational—arriving at better estimates of how-the-world-is—can diminish feelings or intensify them. Sometimes we run away from strong feelings by denying the facts, by flinching away from the view of the world that gave rise to the powerful emotion. If so, then as you study the skills of rationality and train yourself not to deny facts, your feelings will become stronger.

In my early days I was never quite certain whether it was all right to feel things strongly—whether it was allowed, whether it was proper. I do not think this confusion arose only from my youthful misunderstanding of rationality. I have observed similar troubles in people who do not even aspire to be rationalists; when they are happy, they wonder if they are really allowed to be happy, and when they are sad, they are never quite sure whether to run away from the emotion or not. Since the days of Socrates at least, and probably long before, the way to appear cultured and sophisticated has been to never let anyone see you care strongly about anything. It’s embarrassing to feel—it’s just not done in polite society. You should see the strange looks I get when people realize how much I care about rationality. It’s not the unusual subject, I think, but that they’re not used to seeing sane adults who visibly care about anything.

But I know, now, that there’s nothing wrong with feeling strongly. Ever since I adopted the rule of “That which can be destroyed by the truth should be,” I’ve also come to realize “That which the truth nourishes should thrive.” When something good happens, I am happy, and there is no confusion in my mind about whether it is rational for me to be happy. When [something terrible happens](http://yudkowsky.net/other/yehuda/), I do not flee my sadness by searching for fake consolations and false silver linings. I visualize the past and future of humankind, the tens of billions of deaths over our history, the misery and fear, the search for answers, the trembling hands reaching upward out of so much blood, what we could become someday when we make the stars our cities, all that darkness and all that light—I know that I can never truly understand it, and I haven’t the words to say. Despite all my philosophy I am still embarrassed to confess strong emotions, and you’re probably uncomfortable hearing them. But I know, now, that it is rational to feel.
