## 我所说的“理性”是什么意思？

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

我指的是两件事：

1. **认知理性**：系统性地提升你信念的准确性。

2. **工具理性**：系统性地实现你的价值目标。

第一个概念很简单。当你睁开眼睛环顾房间时，你会定位你的笔记本电脑在桌子上的位置，也会定位书架在墙边的位置。如果你的眼睛或大脑出了问题，你的心智模型可能会认为某处有书架，实际上那里并没有，当你走过去取书时就会失望。

这就是持有错误信念的感觉——你的世界地图与疆域不符。认知理性就是要建立准确的地图。这种信念与现实的对应关系通常被称为“真理”，我也乐于这样称呼它。<sup>1</sup>

而工具理性，则是驾驭现实——让未来朝你希望的方向发展。它是一种选择行动的艺术，使结果在你的偏好排序中更高。我有时称之为“赢”。

所以，理性就是形成真实信念，并做出有助于你“赢”的决策。

（这里的“真理”并不等于“确定无疑”，因为即使我们不确定，也可以大大提高信念的准确概率；而“赢”也不是“以他人为代价的胜利”，因为我们的价值观包括我们关心的一切，包括他人。）

当人们说“X 是理性的！”时，通常只是更强烈地表达“我认为 X 是真的”或“我认为 X 是好的”。那么，为什么还要有“理性”这个词，而不仅仅用“真”和“好”？

类似的论证也可以用来反对“真”这个词。你没必要说“雪是白色的这件事是真的”，直接说“雪是白色的”就行。“真理”这个概念的用处在于，它让我们能讨论地图与疆域对应的一般特征。“真实模型通常比虚假模型能做出更好的实验预测”是一个有用的归纳，而不用“真”或“准确”这样的概念就无法表达。

同样，“理性代理人会做出最大化一致效用函数概率期望的决策”这种思想依赖于（工具）理性的概念，而“吃蔬菜是理性的”其实可以换成“吃蔬菜有用”或“吃蔬菜对你有好处”。我们需要“理性”这样的概念，来总结那些系统性地产生真理或价值的思维方式——以及我们偏离这些标准的系统性方式。

正如前文所述，实验心理学家有时会发现人类推理非常奇怪。例如，有人认为“比尔会弹爵士乐”的概率小于“比尔是会弹爵士乐的会计师”。这似乎很奇怪，因为任何会弹爵士乐的会计师显然也是会弹爵士乐的人。但我们凭什么说这种判断是错的呢？

实验心理学家用两大金标准：概率论和决策论。

概率论是一套支撑理性信念的法则。概率数学同样适用于“判断书架在哪里”与“估算凯撒头上有多少根头发”，尽管我们对“凯撒秃顶”这个命题的证据比“我房间里有书架”要复杂和间接得多。本质上，这都是如何处理证据和观察、更新信念的问题。同理，决策论是一套支撑理性行动的法则，无论目标和可选项是什么都适用。

用“P(某事)”表示“某事发生的概率”，“P(A,B)”表示“A 和 B 同时发生的概率”。概率论的普遍法则是 P(A) ≥ P(A,B)，所以判断“比尔会弹爵士乐”的概率小于“比尔是会弹爵士乐的会计师”的概率，就是错误的。

严格来说，这种概率判断是非贝叶斯的。符合一致概率分布的信念，以及最大化一致效用函数概率期望的决策，被称为“贝叶斯式”的。

我要强调，这并不是流行文化中常见的“理性”概念。人们可能用同样的“理性”一词，既指“像星际迷航里的斯波克先生那样行动”，也指“像贝叶斯主义者那样行动”；但像斯波克那样行事，并不会让你在认知或工具理性上更进一步。<sup>2</sup>

这些还不能完全涵盖“理性”在实践中的含义，主要有两个原因：

首先，完整形式的贝叶斯公式在大多数现实问题上计算量太大，无法实际操作。没人能真的算出所有数学，就像没人能通过计算夸克运动来预测股市。

这也是为什么有一个叫“Less Wrong”的网站，而不是一页纸写下公理就完事。要在人的大脑中发现真理、实现价值，还有一整套艺术：我们要学会自己的缺陷，克服偏见，防止自欺，调整好情绪去面对真相并采取行动，等等等等。

其次，有时连数学本身的意义也会被质疑。例如，[人择问题](http://www.anthropic-principle.com/?q=anthropic_principle/primer)中观察者数量不确定，就会质疑概率论的精确规则。又如 Newcomb 问题等，其他代理人可能在你决策前预测你的行为，也会质疑决策论的精确规则。<sup>3</sup>

当我们最好的形式化方法仍然不够时，我们可以回到“真理”和“赢”这些更简单的想法。如果你是刚开始研究火的科学家，直接指着篝火说“火就是那团橙色发亮的热东西”比说“我定义火为释放燃素的炼金转化”要明智得多。你当然不该因为无法定义某物就忽略它。我背不出广义相对论的公式，但如果我从悬崖上跳下，还是会摔下去。对认知偏差和其他真理障碍也是如此——即使我们无法简明地定义“非理性”，它们的伤害也不会减轻。

在这种情况下，试图通过给“理性”下新定义来解决问题是徒劳的，比如说“因此我喜欢的答案就是‘理性’的定义”。这只会引出“为什么要在乎你的定义？”的问题。我对概率论感兴趣，不是因为它是拉普拉斯传下来的圣言，而是因为我相信贝叶斯式的信念更新（配合奥卡姆先验）能让我们系统性地更接近准确、让地图更贴合疆域。

还有一些思考方式，概率论和决策论都无法完全回答——比如得知真相后该如何面对它。在这里，试图用某种方式定义“理性”并不能给出答案，只是预设了答案。

我不是来争论某个词的含义的，即使这个词是“理性”。给特定概念贴上字母序列，是为了让两个人能交流——帮助思想从一个大脑传递到另一个大脑。你无法通过改变词语的定义来改变现实或证明观点。

所以，只要你明白我用“理性”这个词，以及“认知理性”“工具理性”这些子词，指的是什么概念，我们就已经完成了关于“理性”定义的全部交流。剩下要讨论的，不是“理性”这几个音节该指什么，而是什么才是好的思考方式。

如果你说，“对我来说相信 X 是（认知上）理性的，但真相是 Y”，那你很可能用“理性”表达的不是我想说的意思。（比如，“理性”应该在反思下自洽——“理性地”看证据和“理性地”思考大脑如何处理证据，不应得出两个不同结论。）

同样，如果你发现自己说，“对我来说做 X 是（工具上）理性的，但做 Y 才是对的”，那你几乎肯定用“理性”或“对”表达了别的意思。我用“理性”这个词，是规范性的，用来指称值得追求的思维模式。

在这种情况下——或任何其他人们对词义有分歧的情况——你应该用更具体的语言代替“理性”：“对自己有利的做法是逃跑，但我希望至少会试着把孩子从铁轨上拉开”，或者“因果决策理论通常认为你应该在 Newcomb 问题中选两个盒子，但我更想要一百万美元。”

事实上，我建议你回头把这篇文章里所有“理性”都替换成“fooza”，看看我的意思有没有变化。如果有，我会说：追求的不是理性，而是 fooza。

“理性”这个词有潜在的陷阱，但在很多非边界情形下，它完全可以表达我的意思。“非理性”也是如此。在这些情况下我并不避讳使用。

但我们还是要小心别滥用这个词。光大声喊“理性”并不会加分。如果你过多谈论“道”，你就无法得道。

<sup>2</sup> 认为理性就是严格优先考虑语言推理而忽视感受，这正是一个例子。贝叶斯理性同样适用于冲动、直觉、感知和无言的直觉，而不仅仅是断言。

我举过睁开眼睛、环顾四周、在脑中建立包含书架的房间模型的例子。现代理性的概念足够广泛，能把你的眼睛和大脑视觉区都视为“制图工具”，也能把本能和情感纳入信念与目标的计算。

## What Do I Mean By “Rationality”?

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

I mean two things:

1. **Epistemic rationality**: systematically improving the accuracy of your beliefs.

2. **Instrumental rationality**: systematically achieving your values.

The first concept is simple enough. When you open your eyes and look at the room around you, you’ll locate your laptop in relation to the table, and you’ll locate a bookcase in relation to the wall. If something goes wrong with your eyes, or your brain, then your mental model might say there’s a bookcase where no bookcase exists, and when you go over to get a book, you’ll be disappointed.

This is what it’s like to have a false belief, a map of the world that doesn’t correspond to the territory. Epistemic rationality is about building accurate maps instead. This correspondence between belief and reality is commonly called “truth,” and I’m happy to call it that.<sup>1</sup>

Instrumental rationality, on the other hand, is about steering reality—sending the future where you want it to go. It’s the art of choosing actions that lead to outcomes ranked higher in your preferences. I sometimes call this “winning.”

So rationality is about forming true beliefs and making decisions that help you win.

(Where truth doesn't mean “certainty,” since we can do plenty to increase the probability that our beliefs are accurate even though we're uncertain; and winning doesn't mean “winning at others' expense,” since our values include everything we care about, including other people.)

When people say “X is rational!” it’s usually just a more strident way of saying “I think X is true” or “I think X is good.” So why have an additional word for “rational” as well as “true” and “good”?

An analogous argument can be given against using “true.” There is no need to say “it is true that snow is white” when you could just say “snow is white.” What makes the idea of truth useful is that it allows us to talk about the general features of map-territory correspondence. “True models usually produce better experimental predictions than false models” is a useful generalization, and it’s not one you can make without using a concept like “true” or “accurate.”

Similarly, “Rational agents make decisions that maximize the probabilistic expectation of a coherent utility function” is the kind of thought that depends on a concept of (instrumental) rationality, whereas “It’s rational to eat vegetables” can probably be replaced with “It’s useful to eat vegetables” or “It’s in your interest to eat vegetables.” We need a concept like “rational” in order to note general facts about those ways of thinking that systematically produce truth or value—and the systematic ways in which we fall short of those standards.

As we’ve observed in the previous essays, experimental psychologists sometimes uncover human reasoning that seems very strange. For example, someone rates the probability “Bill plays jazz” as less than the probability “Bill is an accountant who plays jazz.” This seems like an odd judgment, since any particular jazz-playing accountant is obviously a jazz player. But to what higher vantage point do we appeal in saying that the judgment is wrong ?

Experimental psychologists use two gold standards: probability theory, and decision theory.

Probability theory is the set of laws underlying rational belief. The mathematics of probability applies equally to “figuring out where your bookcase is” and “estimating how many hairs were on Julius Caesars head,” even though our evidence for the claim “Julius Caesar was bald” is likely to be more complicated and indirect than our evidence for the claim “theres a bookcase in my room.” It’s all the same problem of how to process the evidence and observations to update one’s beliefs. Similarly, decision theory is the set of laws underlying rational action, and is equally applicable regardless of what one’s goals and available options are.

Let “P(such-and-such)” stand for “the probability that such-and-such happens,” and “P(A,B)” for “the probability that both A and B happen.” Since it is a universal law of probability theory that P(A) ≥ P(A,B), the judgment that P(Bill plays jazz) is less than P(Bill plays jazz, Bill is an accountant) is labeled incorrect.

To keep it technical, you would say that this probability judgment is non-Bayesian. Beliefs that conform to a coherent probability distribution, and decisions that maximize the probabilistic expectation of a coherent utility function, are called “Bayesian.”

I should emphasize that this isn't the notion of rationality thats common in popular culture. People may use the same string of sounds, “ra-tio-nal,” to refer to “acting like Mr. Spock of Star Trek” and “acting like a Bayesian”; but this doesn't mean that acting Spock-like helps one hair with epistemic or instrumental rationality.<sup>2</sup>

All of this does not quite exhaust the problem of what is meant in practice by “rationality,” for two major reasons:

First, the Bayesian formalisms in their full form are computationally intractable on most real-world problems. No one can actually calculate and obey the math, any more than you can predict the stock market by calculating the movements of quarks.

This is why there is a whole site called “Less Wrong,” rather than a single page that simply states the formal axioms and calls it a day. There’s a whole further art to finding the truth and accomplishing value from inside a human mind: we have to learn our own flaws, overcome our biases, prevent ourselves from self-deceiving, get ourselves into good emotional shape to confront the truth and do what needs doing, et cetera, et cetera.

Second, sometimes the meaning of the math itself is called into question. The exact rules of probability theory are called into question by, e.g., [anthropic problems](http://www.anthropic-principle.com/?q=anthropic_principle/primer) in which the number of observers is uncertain. The exact rules of decision theory are called into question by, e.g., Newcomblike problems in which other agents may predict your decision before it happens.<sup>3</sup>

In cases where our best formalizations still come up short, we can return to simpler ideas like “truth” and “winning.” If you are a scientist just beginning to investigate fire, it might be a lot wiser to point to a campfire and say “Fire is that orangey-bright hot stuff over there,” rather than saying “I define fire as an alchemical transmutation of substances which releases phlogiston.” You certainly shouldn’t ignore something just because you can’t define it. I can't quote the equations of General Relativity from memory, but nonetheless if I walk off a cliff, I'll fall. And we can say the same of cognitive biases and other obstacles to truth—they won't hit any less hard if it turns out we can't define compactly what “irrationality” is.

In cases like these, it is futile to try to settle the problem by coming up with some new definition of the word “rational” and saying, “Therefore my preferred answer, by definition, is what is meant by the word ‘rational.’ ” This simply raises the question of why anyone should pay attention to your definition. I’m not interested in probability theory because it is the holy word handed down from Laplace. I’m interested in Bayesian-style belief-updating (with Occam priors) because I expect that this style of thinking gets us systematically closer to, you know, accuracy, the map that reflects the territory.

And then there are questions of how to think that seem not quite answered by either probability theory or decision theory—like the question of how to feel about the truth once you have it. Here, again, trying to define “rationality” a particular way doesn’t support an answer, but merely presumes one.

I am not here to argue the meaning of a word, not even if that word is “rationality.” The point of attaching sequences of letters to particular concepts is to let two people communicate—to help transport thoughts from one mind to another. You cannot change reality, or prove the thought, by manipulating which meanings go with which words.

So if you understand what concept I am generally getting at with this word “rationality,” and with the sub-terms “epistemic rationality” and “instrumental rationality,” we have communicated: we have accomplished everything there is to accomplish by talking about how to define “rationality.” What’s left to discuss is not what meaning to attach to the syllables “ra-tio-na-li-ty”; what’s left to discuss is what is a good way to think.

If you say, “It’s (epistemically) rational for me to believe X, but the truth is Y,” then you are probably using the word “rational” to mean something other than what I have in mind. (E.g., “rationality” should be consistent under reflection—“rationally” looking at the evidence, and “rationally” considering how your mind processes the evidence, shouldn’t lead to two different conclusions.)

Similarly, if you find yourself saying, “The (instrumentally) rational thing for me to do is X, but the right thing for me to do is Y,” then you are almost certainly using some other meaning for the word “rational” or the word “right.” I use the term “rationality” normatively, to pick out desirable patterns of thought.

In this case—or in any other case where people disagree about word meanings—you should substitute more specific language in place of “rational”: “The self-benefiting thing to do is to run away, but I hope I would at least try to drag the child off the railroad tracks,” or “Causal decision theory as usually formulated says you should two-box on Newcomb’s Problem, but I’d rather have a million dollars.”

In fact, I recommend reading back through this essay, replacing every instance of “rational” with “foozal,” and seeing if that changes the connotations of what I’m saying any. If so, I say: strive not for rationality, but for foozality.

The word “rational” has potential pitfalls, but there are plenty of non-borderline cases where “rational” works fine to communicate what I’m getting at. Likewise “irrational.” In these cases I’m not afraid to use it.

Yet one should be careful not to overuse that word. One receives no points merely for pronouncing it loudly. If you speak overmuch of the Way, you will not attain it.

<sup>2</sup> The idea that rationality is about strictly privileging verbal reasoning over feelings is a case in point. Bayesian rationality applies to urges, hunches, perceptions, and wordless intuitions, not just to assertions.

I gave the example of opening your eyes, looking around you, and building a mental model of a room containing a bookcase against the wall. The modern idea of rationality is general enough to include your eyes and your brains visual areas as things-that-map, and to include instincts and emotions in the belief-and-goal calculus.
