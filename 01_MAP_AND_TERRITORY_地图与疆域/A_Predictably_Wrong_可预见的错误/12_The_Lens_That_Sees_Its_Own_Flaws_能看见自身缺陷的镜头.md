## 能看见自身缺陷的镜头

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

光线从太阳出发，照射到你的鞋带上并被反射；一些光子进入你的瞳孔，击中你的视网膜；光子的能量触发神经冲动；神经冲动被传递到大脑的视觉处理区域；在那里，光学信息被处理并重建为一个三维模型，被识别为一根松开的鞋带；于是你相信你的鞋带松了。

这就是刻意思考的理性秘密——这一切过程并不是[魔法](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/)，而且你可以理解它。你可以理解自己是如何看到鞋带的。你可以思考哪种思维过程能让信念映照现实，哪种不能。

老鼠能看见，但它们无法理解“看见”这回事。你能理解“看见”，因此你能做到老鼠做不到的事。请花点时间对此[感到惊奇](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/j3/science_as_curiositystopper/)，因为这确实令人惊叹。

老鼠能看见，但它们不知道自己有视觉皮层，所以无法修正视觉错觉。老鼠的心智世界里有猫、洞、奶酪和捕鼠夹——但没有老鼠大脑。它们的“相机”不会给自己的镜头拍照。而我们人类，可以看着一张[看似奇怪的图片](http://www.richrock.com/gifs/optical-illusion-wheels-circles-rotating.png)，意识到我们看到的部分其实是镜头本身。你不必总是相信自己的眼睛，但你必须意识到你有眼睛——你必须在心里区分地图与疆域、感官与现实。别以为这是一种微不足道的能力，要记住在动物界中它有多罕见。

科学的全部思想，其实就是对让心智内容更可靠地映照世界内容的过程进行反思性推理。这是老鼠永远不会发明的东西。思考“做可重复实验以证伪理论”这件事，我们就能明白它为何有效。科学不是一个[独立的权威领域](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i8/religions_claim_to_be_nondisprovable/)，不是远离现实生活、普通人无法理解的东西。科学也不仅仅适用于[实验室内部](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/gv/outside_the_laboratory/)。科学本身，是现实世界中可以理解的过程，它让大脑与现实产生关联。

只要你思考一下，科学就是有道理的。但老鼠无法思考“思考”本身，这就是它们没有科学的原因。我们不应忽视这一点的奇迹——也不应忽视它赋予我们个人的潜在力量，而不仅仅是科学共同体。

当然，理解思维引擎可能比理解蒸汽机复杂一些——但本质上并没有什么不同。

有一次，我去 EFNet 的 #philosophy 聊天室问：“你认为未来20年会发生核战争吗？如果不会，为什么？”有个人回答说他觉得100年内都不会有核战争，因为“现在所有参与核战争决策的人都没有兴趣。”我问：“那你为什么要把这个判断延伸到100年？”他答：“纯粹是希望。”

反思整个思考过程，我们可以看出为什么核战争的念头让这个人不开心，也能看出他的头脑因此拒绝相信它。但如果你想象有十亿个世界——比如 Everett 分支，或 Tegmark 的平行宇宙<sup>1</sup>——这种思考过程并不会让乐观主义者系统性地落在没有核战争发生的分支上。<sup>2</sup>

问“哪些信念让你快乐”其实是在向内看，而不是向外看——它只能告诉你关于自己的事情，但并不是与环境纠缠的证据。我并不反对幸福，但幸福应该来自你对世界的认知，而不是篡改你的心智画笔。

如果你能看到这一点——如果你能看到希望让你的第一层思考偏离得太多——如果你能把自己的大脑理解为一个有缺陷的制图引擎——那么你就可以进行反思性的修正。大脑是一个有缺陷的镜头，用来观察现实。这对老鼠和人类都成立。但人类大脑是一种能理解自身缺陷的有缺陷的镜头——能理解自己的系统性错误、偏差，并对其进行二阶修正。实际上，这让这只镜头变得更强大。不是完美，但强大得多。

<sup>2</sup> 总会有聪明人说：“啊，但因为我有希望，我会更努力工作，推动全球经济，从而帮助防止国家陷入愤怒和绝望，避免核战争的可能。所以这两者还是有关联的。”这时我们就得引入贝叶斯定理，量化地衡量这种关系。你的乐观性格不可能对世界有那么大的影响；它本身无法把核战争的概率降低20%，或者说无法抵消你乐观性格带来的信念偏移。仅仅因为某个事件稍微增加了你判断正确的概率，就大幅调整信念，最终还是会让你的“地图”出错。

## The Lens That Sees Its Own Flaws

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Light leaves the Sun and strikes your shoelaces and bounces off; some photons enter the pupils of your eyes and strike your retina; the energy of the photons triggers neural impulses; the neural impulses are transmitted to the visual-processing areas of the brain; and there the optical information is processed and reconstructed into a 3D model that is recognized as an untied shoelace; and so you believe that your shoelaces are untied.

Here is the secret of deliberate rationality—this whole process is not [magic](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/), and you can understand it. You can understand how you see your shoelaces. You can think about which sort of thinking processes will create beliefs which mirror reality, and which thinking processes will not.

Mice can see, but they can’t understand seeing. You can understand seeing, and because of that, you can do things that mice cannot do. Take a moment to [marvel](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/j3/science_as_curiositystopper/) at this, for it is indeed marvelous.

Mice see, but they don’t know they have visual cortexes, so they can’t correct for optical illusions. A mouse lives in a mental world that includes cats, holes, cheese and mousetraps—but not mouse brains. Their camera does not take pictures of its own lens. But we, as humans, can look at a [seemingly bizarre image](http://www.richrock.com/gifs/optical-illusion-wheels-circles-rotating.png), and realize that part of what we’re seeing is the lens itself. You don’t always have to believe your own eyes, but you have to realize that you have eyes—you must have distinct mental buckets for the map and the territory, for the senses and reality. Lest you think this a trivial ability, remember how rare it is in the animal kingdom.

The whole idea of Science is, simply, reflective reasoning about a more reliable process for making the contents of your mind mirror the contents of the world. It is the sort of thing mice would never invent. Pondering this business of “performing replicable experiments to falsify theories,” we can see why it works. Science is not a [separate magisterium](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i8/religions_claim_to_be_nondisprovable/), far away from real life and the understanding of ordinary mortals. Science is not something that only applies to the [inside of laboratories](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/gv/outside_the_laboratory/). Science, itself, is an understandable process-in-the-world that correlates brains with reality.

Science makes sense, when you think about it. But mice can’t think about thinking, which is why they don’t have Science. One should not overlook the wonder of this—or the potential power it bestows on us as individuals, not just scientific societies.

Admittedly, understanding the engine of thought may be a little more complicated than understanding a steam engine—but it is not a fundamentally different task.

Once upon a time, I went to EFNet’s #philosophy chatroom to ask, “Do you believe a nuclear war will occur in the next 20 years? If no, why not?” One person who answered the question said he didn’t expect a nuclear war for 100 years, because “All of the players involved in decisions regarding nuclear war are not interested right now.” “But why extend that out for 100 years?” I asked. “Pure hope,” was his reply.

Reflecting on this whole thought process, we can see why the thought of nuclear war makes the person unhappy, and we can see how his brain therefore rejects the belief. But if you imagine a billion worlds—Everett branches, or Tegmark duplicates<sup>1</sup>—this thought process will not [systematically correlate](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/jl/what_is_evidence/) optimists to branches in which no nuclear war occurs.<sup>2</sup>

To ask which beliefs make you happy is to turn inward, not outward—it tells you something about yourself, but it is not evidence entangled with the environment. I have nothing against happiness, but it should follow from your picture of the world, rather than tampering with the mental paintbrushes.

If you can see this—if you can see that hope is shifting your first-order thoughts by too large a degree—if you can understand your mind as a mapping engine that has flaws—then you can apply a reflective correction. The brain is a flawed lens through which to see reality. This is true of both mouse brains and human brains. But a human brain is a flawed lens that can understand its own flaws—its systematic errors, its biases—and apply second-order corrections to them. This, in practice, makes the lens far more powerful. Not perfect, but far more powerful.

<sup>2</sup> Some clever fellow is bound to say, “Ah, but since I have hope, I'll work a little harder at my job, pump up the global economy, and thus help to prevent countries from sliding into the angry and hopeless state where nuclear war is a possibility. So the two events are related after all.” At this point, we have to drag in Bayes’s Theorem and measure the relationship quantitatively. Your optimistic nature cannot have that large an effect on the world; it cannot, of itself, decrease the probability of nuclear war by 20%, or however much your optimistic nature shifted your beliefs. Shifting your beliefs by a large amount, due to an event that only slightly increases your chance of being right, will still mess up your mapping.
