## 前言

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

你现在手中拿着的是两年每日博客文章的合集。回头看这个项目，我发现自己做错了很多事情。我对此并不介意。如果回头看时没发现自己犯过很多错，那就说明自2009年以来，我的写作和理解都没有进步。“哎呀”是我们改进信念和策略时发出的声音；所以如果回头看过去却发现自己没做错什么，那就说明你自那以后既没有学到新东西，也没有改变过想法。

我没有以帮助人们在日常生活中做得更好为目标来写这两年的博客，这是个错误。我当时的目标是帮助人们解决重大、困难、重要的问题，并且选择了一些听起来很厉害、很抽象的问题作为例子。

事后看来，这是我方法上的第二大错误。它和我写作上的最大错误有关，那就是我没有意识到，学习这种宝贵思维方式的最大难题，其实是如何练习它，而不是知道理论。我没意识到练习才是优先级；对此我只能说“哎呀”和“真傻”。

没错，有些大问题确实很大、很重要；但这并不改变一个基本事实：要掌握技能就必须练习，而距离越远的事情越难练习。（现在应用理性中心正在更系统地修正我这个巨大错误。）

我犯的第三个大错误是太关注理性信念，太忽视理性行动。

第四大错误是我本该更好地组织这些系列内容。尤其是我应该更早建立一个维基，让大家更容易按顺序阅读这些文章。

至少这个错误是可以补救的。在本书中，Rob Bensinger 重新排序并尽量重新组织了这些文章，虽然没有试图重写所有内容（不过他确实改写了一些）。

第五个大错误是——在我看来——我试图直白地指出那些在我看来很愚蠢的观点有多愚蠢。我确实努力避免了所谓的“布尔弗主义”谬误，即一上来就说相信某事的人有多蠢；我总是先讨论问题本身，然后才说“所以这很蠢”。但在2009年，我心里还在想，也许有些人公开蔑视顺势疗法是有意义的。我当时认为，现在也仍然认为，有个不幸的现象是：对某些观点的礼貌对待，会让很多人下意识觉得“我说相信这个不会有坏事发生；我不会因为说相信顺势疗法而失去地位”，而喜剧演员的嘲笑有时能让人从梦中惊醒。

现在我会写得更有礼貌一些。我认为不礼貌确实有其作用，也确实有些人因此受益；但我现在更认真地看待这样一个风险：如果社区里对低地位外来观点的正常反应是公开嘲笑和蔑视，会带来不良后果。

尽管我犯了这个错误，我还是很高兴地说，到目前为止，我的读者们都非常好，没有把我的言辞当作欺凌或贬低他人的借口。（我特别想提一下 Scott Alexander，他比我更善良，也越来越擅长写这些话题，也许他对 Less Wrong 社区健康氛围的形成也有一份功劳。）

能够回头说“我失败过”，意味着你曾经有目标。那么，我到底想做什么？

有一种宝贵的思维方式，至今还没有在学校里系统教授。它根本没有被系统地传授。只有那些从小读《费曼先生，你在开玩笑吧》这类书，或者在高中遇到极好老师的人，才会自然而然地吸收这种思维方式。

最著名的，这种思维方式和科学、实验方法有关。科学的那部分，是你走出去观察宇宙，而不是凭空想象。是你在实验结果不支持理论时说“哎呀”，然后放弃错误理论的那部分。

但这种思维方式远不止于此。它比你进实验室时戴上的护目镜、离开时摘下的护目镜更深刻、更普遍。它适用于日常生活，虽然这部分更微妙、更难。但如果你不能在发现某事行不通时说“哎呀”并放弃，那你只能不断地往自己脚上开枪。你只能不断地装填猎枪，不断地扣动扳机。你肯定见过这样的人。在你生活中某个你不愿回想的角落，你自己也曾是这样的人。如果有一种思维方式能帮我们停止这种行为，那该多好。

尽管我犯的错误很大，这两年的博客写作似乎还是帮到了出乎意料多的人，帮得也出乎意料地多。它并不总是有效，但有时确实有效。

在现代社会，几乎没人教理性信念和决策的技能，相关的数学和科学知识也几乎没人教……所以，哪怕只是读一大堆充满哲学和科学问题的“脑力倾倒”，也确实对你有意想不到的好处。从十几个不同角度走一遍，有时能让你隐约体会到核心的节奏。

因为归根结底，这一切其实都是一回事。我谈论了遥远、重要的大问题，却忽略了眼前的生活，但支配它们的规律其实并无不同。我关注的部分有巨大空白，选的例子也都错了；但归根结底，这一切都是一回事。即使犯了这么多错，即使无数次说“哎呀”……我依然为此感到自豪。

即使五年过去，我仍然觉得，这总比什么都没有要好。

## Preface 

--by Eliezer Yudkowsky

You hold in your hands a compilation of two years of daily blog posts. In retrospect, I look back on that project and see a large number of things I did completely wrong. I’m fine with that. Looking back and not seeing a huge number of things I did wrong would mean that neither my writing nor my understanding had improved since 2009. Oops is the sound we make when we improve our beliefs and strategies; so to look back at a time and not see anything you did wrong means that you haven’t learned anything or changed your mind since then.

It was a mistake that I didn’t write my two years of blog posts with the intention of helping people do better in their everyday lives. I wrote it with the intention of helping people solve big, difficult, important problems, and I chose impressive-sounding, abstract problems as my examples.

In retrospect, this was the second-largest mistake in my approach. It ties in to the first-largest mistake in my writing, which was that I didn’t realize that the big problem in learning this valuable way of thinking was figuring out how to practice it, not knowing the theory. I didn’t realize that part was the priority; and regarding this I can only say “Oops” and “Duh.”

Yes, sometimes those big issues really are big and really are important; but that doesn’t change the basic truth that to master skills you need to practice them and it’s harder to practice on things that are further away. (Today the Center for Applied Rationality is working on repairing this huge mistake of mine in a more systematic fashion.)

A third huge mistake I made was to focus too much on rational belief, too little on rational action.

The fourth-largest mistake I made was that I should have better organized the content I was presenting in the sequences. In particular, I should have created a wiki much earlier, and made it easier to read the posts in sequence.

That mistake at least is correctable. In the present work Rob Bensinger has reordered the posts and reorganized them as much as he can without trying to rewrite all the actual material (though he’s rewritten a bit of it).

My fifth huge mistake was that I—as I saw it—tried to speak plainly about the stupidity of what appeared to me to be stupid ideas. I did try to avoid the fallacy known as Bulverism, which is where you open your discussion by talking about how stupid people are for believing something; I would always discuss the issue first, and only afterwards say, “And so this is stupid.” But in 2009 it was an open question in my mind whether it might be important to have some people around who expressed contempt for homeopathy. I thought, and still do think, that there is an unfortunate problem wherein treating ideas courteously is processed by many people on some level as “Nothing bad will happen to me if I say I believe this; I won’t lose status if I say I believe in homeopathy,” and that derisive laughter by comedians can help people wake up from the dream.

Today I would write more courteously, I think. The discourtesy did serve a function, and I think there were people who were helped by reading it; but I now take more seriously the risk of building communities where the normal and expected reaction to low-status outsider views is open mockery and contempt.

Despite my mistake, I am happy to say that my readership has so far been amazingly good about not using my rhetoric as an excuse to bully or belittle others. (I want to single out Scott Alexander in particular here, who is a nicer person than I am and an increasingly amazing writer on these topics, and may deserve part of the credit for making the culture of Less Wrong a healthy one.)

To be able to look backwards and say that you’ve “failed” implies that you had goals. So what was it that I was trying to do?

There is a certain valuable way of thinking, which is not yet taught in schools, in this present day. This certain way of thinking is not taught systematically at all. It is just absorbed by people who grow up reading books like Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman or who have an unusually great teacher in high school.

Most famously, this certain way of thinking has to do with science, and with the experimental method. The part of science where you go out and look at the universe instead of just making things up. The part where you say “Oops” and give up on a bad theory when the experiments don’t support it.

But this certain way of thinking extends beyond that. It is deeper and more universal than a pair of goggles you put on when you enter a laboratory and take off when you leave. It applies to daily life, though this part is subtler and more difficult. But if you can’t say “Oops” and give up when it looks like something isn’t working, you have no choice but to keep shooting yourself in the foot. You have to keep reloading the shotgun and you have to keep pulling the trigger. You know people like this. And somewhere, someplace in your life you’d rather not think about, you are people like this. It would be nice if there was a certain way of thinking that could help us stop doing that.

In spite of how large my mistakes were, those two years of blog posting appeared to help a surprising number of people a surprising amount. It didn’t work reliably, but it worked sometimes.

In modern society so little is taught of the skills of rational belief and decision-making, so little of the mathematics and sciences underlying them . . . that it turns out that just reading through a massive brain-dump full of problems in philosophy and science can, yes, be surprisingly good for you. Walking through all of that, from a dozen different angles, can sometimes convey a glimpse of the central rhythm.

Because it is all, in the end, one thing. I talked about big important distant problems and neglected immediate life, but the laws governing them aren’t actually different. There are huge gaps in which parts I focused on, and I picked all the wrong examples; but it is all in the end one thing. I am proud to look back and say that, even after all the mistakes I made, and all the other times I said “Oops” . . .

Even five years later, it still appears to me that this is better than nothing.
