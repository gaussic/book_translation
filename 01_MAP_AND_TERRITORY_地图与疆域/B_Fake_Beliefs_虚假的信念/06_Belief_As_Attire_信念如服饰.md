## 信念如服饰

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

到目前为止，我区分了三种信念：作为[预期控制器的信念](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/)、[相信信念](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/)、[宣称与呐喊](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i6/professing_and_cheering/)。其中，我们可以把“预期控制型信念”称为“正统信念”，而其他形式则是“非正统信念”。正统信念也可能是错误或非理性的，比如有人真心预期祈祷能治愈生病的婴儿。但其他形式严格来说甚至“算不上信念”。

还有一种非正统信念，就是作为群体认同的信念——作为归属感的方式。Robin Hanson 用了一个很好的[比喻](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i6/professing_and_cheering/egb)：穿着特殊服饰，比如神父的法衣或犹太人的小帽，所以我称之为“信念如服饰”。

从[现实的人类心理学](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i0/are_your_enemies_innately_evil/)来看，驾驶飞机撞向世贸中心的穆斯林，毫无疑问会把自己视为捍卫真理、正义和伊斯兰之道的英雄，就像电影《独立日》里对抗外星怪物一样。只有极其缺乏社会经验的书呆子，才会在阿拉巴马的酒吧里把这些话说出来。这不是美国人会说的话。美国人会说，恐怖分子“憎恨我们的自由”，把飞机撞进大楼是“懦夫的行为”。你不能在同一句话里同时说“英勇的自我牺牲”和“自杀式炸弹袭击者”，即使只是为了准确描述敌人眼中的世界。自杀式袭击者的勇气和利他主义，这一概念本身就是“敌人的服饰”——你能分辨出来，因为敌人会这样说。自杀式袭击者的懦弱和反社会，则是“美国的服饰”。你无法用引号来描述敌人如何看待世界；那就像万圣节穿纳粹制服一样。

“信念如服饰”也许能解释人们为何会对非正统信念充满激情。仅仅是“相信信念”或宗教宣称，很难产生真正深刻而强烈的情感影响。至少我猜是这样；我承认我不是这方面的专家。但我的印象是：那些已经不再像真的那样预期宗教为真的人，会极力说服自己自己很有激情，这种绝望有时会被误认为是激情。但那已不是他们童年时的那团火焰。

另一方面，人类很容易真诚、热情、发自内心地归属于一个群体，为[自己喜欢的运动队呐喊助威](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/gt/a_fable_of_science_and_politics/)。<sup>1</sup> 认同一个部落是一种极其强烈的情感力量。人们会为此而死。一旦你让人们认同某个部落，这个部落的“服饰信念”就会被他们以归属的全部激情表达出来。

<sup>1</sup>这正是“共和党对民主党”以及其他国家类似[伪二元对立](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/hu/the_third_alternative/)骗局的基础，但这是另一个话题了。

## Belief as Attire

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

I have so far distinguished between belief as [anticipation-controller](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/), [belief in belief](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/), [professing and cheering](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i6/professing_and_cheering/).  Of these, we might call anticipation-controlling beliefs "proper beliefs" and the other forms "improper belief". Proper belief can be wrong or irrational, as when someone genuinely anticipates that prayer will cure their sick baby. But the other forms are arguably “not belief at all.”

Yet another form of improper belief is belief as group identification—as a way of belonging. Robin Hanson uses the excellent [metaphor](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i6/professing_and_cheering/egb) of wearing unusual clothing, a group uniform like a priest’s vestments or a Jewish skullcap, and so I will call this “belief as attire.”

In terms of [humanly realistic psychology](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i0/are_your_enemies_innately_evil/), the Muslims who flew planes into the World Trade Center undoubtedly saw themselves as heroes defending truth, justice, and the Islamic Way from hideous alien monsters a la the movie Independence Day. Only a very inexperienced nerd, the sort of nerd who has no idea how non-nerds see the world, would say this out loud in an Alabama bar. It is not an American thing to say. The American thing to say is that the terrorists “hate our freedom” and that flying a plane into a building is a “cowardly act.” You cannot say the phrases “heroic self-sacrifice” and “suicide bomber” in the same sentence, even for the sake of accurately describing how the Enemy sees the world. The very concept of the courage and altruism of a suicide bomber is Enemy attire—you can tell, because the Enemy talks about it. The cowardice and sociopathy of a suicide bomber is American attire. There are no quote marks you can use to talk about how the Enemy sees the world; it would be like dressing up as a Nazi for Halloween.

Belief-as-attire may help explain how people can be passionate about improper beliefs. Mere belief in belief, or religious professing, would have some trouble creating genuine, deep, powerful emotional effects. Or so I suspect; I confess I’m not an expert here. But my impression is this: People who’ve stopped anticipating-as-if their religion is true, will go to great lengths to convince themselves they are passionate, and this desperation can be mistaken for passion. But it’s not the same fire they had as a child.

On the other hand, it is very easy for a human being to genuinely, passionately, gut-level belong to a group, to [cheer for their favorite sports team](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/gt/a_fable_of_science_and_politics/).<sup>1</sup> Identifying with a tribe is a very strong emotional force. People will die for it. And once you get people to identify with a tribe, the beliefs which are the attire of that tribe will be spoken with the full passion of belonging to that tribe.

<sup>1</sup>This is the foundation on which rests the swindle of “Republicans vs. Democrats” and analogous [false dilemmas](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/hu/the_third_alternative/) in other countries, but that’s a topic for another time.
