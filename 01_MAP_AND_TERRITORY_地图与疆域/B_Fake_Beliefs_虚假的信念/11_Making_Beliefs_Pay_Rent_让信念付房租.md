## 让信念为预期体验“付房租”

古老的寓言是这样开始的：

如果一棵树在森林中倒下，但没有人听见，它会发出声音吗？一个人说：“会的，因为它在空气中产生了振动。”另一个人说：“不会，因为没有任何大脑进行听觉处理。”

如果说理性武术中有一项基础技能，是所有其他技巧的根基，那也许就是这个：在你自己的头脑中，能够分辨出你对某事有心理地图的迹象，以及你没有心理地图的迹象。

假设树倒之后，这两位争论者一起走进森林。一个人会期待看到树倒向右边，另一个人会期待看到树倒向左边吗？假设在树倒之前，他们在树旁放了一个录音机。等他们回放录音时，一个人会期待听到与另一个人不同的内容吗？假设他们给世界上任何一个大脑接上脑电图仪，有人会期待看到不同的脑电波吗？

尽管两人争论，一个说“不”，另一个说“是”，但他们并不期待会有不同的体验。他们以为自己对世界有不同的模型，但在他们预期会发生什么这点上并无差别；他们的世界地图在任何感官细节上都没有分歧。

人们很容易试图通过坚持“唯一合法的信念就是对感官体验的预期”来消除这类错误。但事实上，世界上确实存在许多我们无法直接感知的东西。我们看不到砖块内部的原子，但原子确实存在。你脚下有地板，但你并不能直接体验地板本身；你看到的是地板反射的光，或者更准确地说，是你的视网膜和视觉皮层处理过的那束光。通过“看到地板”来推断地板的存在，其实是退回到体验背后的未见之因。这看起来像是很短、很直接的一步，但它依然是一种推断。

你站在高楼顶上，旁边有一座带有时针、分针和滴答作响的秒针的落地钟。你手里拿着一个保龄球，把它从楼顶扔下。你会在钟的哪一秒听到保龄球撞击地面的声音？

要精确回答，你必须用到诸如“地球重力加速度是9.8米每二次方秒”“这栋楼大约有120米高”这样的信念。这些信念并不是无言的感官预期，而是带有语言色彩的命题。把这两个信念描述为由词语组成的句子也不算夸张。但这两个信念有一个推理上的结果，那就是一个直接的感官预期——如果你在秒针指向12时扔下球，你会预期在听到撞击声时秒针指向1。为了尽可能精确地预期感官体验，我们必须处理那些并非直接感官预期的信念。

智人最强大的能力之一，就是比世界上任何其他物种都更善于建构“未见之物”的模型。但这也是我们最大的弱点之一。人类常常相信那些不仅未见，甚至根本不存在的东西。

同一个大脑，既能在感官体验背后建构推断因果的网络，也能建构与感官体验无关或联系很弱的因果网络。炼金术士相信燃素导致了火——我们可以简单地画一个“燃素”节点，再画一条箭头指向他们对篝火噼啪作响的感官体验——但这种信念并不能带来任何事先的预测；燃素与体验之间的联系总是在体验之后才被配置，而不是提前约束体验。

或者，假设你的英语教授教你，著名作家 Wulky Wilkinsen 实际上是一位“逆向定位作家”，你可以通过他的书中展现的“异化再升华”看出来。也许你的教授之所以知道这些，是因为他们的教授告诉他们；但他们唯一能说的关于“再升华”的内容，就是它是逆向定位思想的特征，而逆向定位的特征就是有异化再升华。那么，这意味着你应该从 Wulky Wilkinsen 的书中期待什么？

什么都没有。这个“信念”，如果你愿意这么称呼它，根本没有和任何感官体验相连。但你最好记住“Wulky Wilkinsen”有“逆向定位性”属性，还有“异化再升华”属性，这样你才能在即将到来的测验中复述出来。这两个信念彼此相连，但依然没有和任何预期体验相连。

我们可以建立起只彼此相连的整套信念网络——称之为“漂浮信念”。在动物界，这是一种人类独有的缺陷，是智人构建更通用、更灵活信念网络能力的异化。

理性主义者的经验主义美德，就是不断追问我们的信念预言了哪些体验——或者更好的是，哪些体验被它们排除了。你相信燃素是火的原因吗？那么你因此预期会看到什么？你相信 Wulky Wilkinsen 是逆向定位作家？那么你因此预期会看到什么？不是“异化再升华”，而是你会经历什么？你相信如果一棵树在森林中倒下，无人听见，它依然会发出声音？那么你因此必然会经历什么？

更进一步，最好问：你必然不会经历什么？你相信生命力（élan vital）解释了生物神秘的活力？那么这个信念不允许发生什么——什么会明确地证伪它？如果没有答案，说明你的信念并不约束体验；它允许任何事情发生。它是漂浮的。

当你争论一个看似事实性的问题时，始终记住你们争论的是哪种预期的差异。如果你找不到预期的差异，你很可能只是在争论信念网络中的标签——甚至更糟，只是在争论漂浮信念，这些信念就像你信念网络上的藤壶。如果你不知道 Wulky Wilkinsen 的写作“逆向定位”意味着什么体验，你们就可以永远争论下去。

最重要的是，不要问“该相信什么”，而要问“该预期什么”。每一个信念问题都应源自一个预期问题，而这个预期问题应当成为探究的核心。每一个信念猜测都应当首先流向一个具体的预期猜测，并且要持续在未来的预期中“付房租”。如果某个信念成了赖账户，就把它驱逐出去。

## Making Beliefs Pay Rent (in Anticipated Experiences)

Thus begins the ancient parable:

If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does it make a sound? One says, “Yes it does, for it makes vibrations in the air.” Another says, “No it does not, for there is no auditory processing in any brain.”

If there’s a foundational skill in the martial art of rationality, a mental stance on which all other technique rests, it might be this one: the ability to spot, inside your own head, psychological signs that you have a mental map of something, and signs that you don’t.

Suppose that, after a tree falls, the two arguers walk into the forest together. Will one expect to see the tree fallen to the right, and the other expect to see the tree fallen to the left? Suppose that before the tree falls, the two leave a sound recorder next to the tree. Would one, playing back the recorder, expect to hear something different from the other? Suppose they attach an electroencephalograph to any brain in the world; would one expect to see a different trace than the other?

Though the two argue, one saying “No,” and the other saying “Yes,” they do not anticipate any different experiences. The two think they have different models of the world, but they have no difference with respect to what they expect will happen to them; their maps of the world do not diverge in any sensory detail.

It’s tempting to try to eliminate this mistake class by insisting that the only legitimate kind of belief is an anticipation of sensory experience. But the world does, in fact, contain much that is not sensed directly. We don’t see the atoms underlying the brick, but the atoms are in fact there. There is a floor beneath your feet, but you don’t experience the floor directly; you see the light reflected from the floor, or rather, you see what your retina and visual cortex have processed of that light. To infer the floor from seeing the floor is to step back into the unseen causes of experience. It may seem like a very short and direct step, but it is still a step.

You stand on top of a tall building, next to a grandfather clock with an hour, minute, and ticking second hand. In your hand is a bowling ball, and you drop it off the roof. On which tick of the clock will you hear the crash of the bowling ball hitting the ground?

To answer precisely, you must use beliefs like Earth’s gravity is 9.8 meters per second per second, and This building is around 120 meters tall. These beliefs are not wordless anticipations of a sensory experience; they are verbalish, propositional. It probably does not exaggerate much to describe these two beliefs as sentences made out of words. But these two beliefs have an inferential consequence that is a direct sensory anticipation—if the clock’s second hand is on the 12 numeral when you drop the ball, you anticipate seeing it on the 1 numeral when you hear the crash five seconds later. To anticipate sensory experiences as precisely as possible, we must process beliefs that are not anticipations of sensory experience.

It is a great strength of Homo sapiens that we can, better than any other species in the world, learn to model the unseen. It is also one of our great weak points. Humans often believe in things that are not only unseen but unreal.

The same brain that builds a network of inferred causes behind sensory experience can also build a network of causes that is not connected to sensory experience, or poorly connected. Alchemists believed that phlogiston caused fire—we could simplistically model their minds by drawing a little node labeled “Phlogiston,” and an arrow from this node to their sensory experience of a crackling campfire—but this belief yielded no advance predictions; the link from phlogiston to experience was always configured after the experience, rather than constraining the experience in advance.

Or suppose your English professor teaches you that the famous writer Wulky Wilkinsen is actually a “retropositional author,” which you can tell because his books exhibit “alienated resublimation.” And perhaps your professor knows all this because their professor told them; but all they’re able to say about resublimation is that it’s characteristic of retropositional thought, and of retropositionality that it’s marked by alienated resublimation. What does this mean you should expect from Wulky Wilkinsen’s books?

Nothing. The belief, if you can call it that, doesn’t connect to sensory experience at all. But you had better remember the propositional assertions that “Wulky Wilkinsen” has the “retropositionality” attribute and also the “alienated resublimation” attribute, so you can regurgitate them on the upcoming quiz. The two beliefs are connected to each other, though still not connected to any anticipated experience.

We can build up whole networks of beliefs that are connected only to each other—call these “floating” beliefs. It is a uniquely human flaw among animal species, a perversion of Homo sapiens’s ability to build more general and flexible belief networks.

The rationalist virtue of empiricism consists of constantly asking which experiences our beliefs predict—or better yet, prohibit. Do you believe that phlogiston is the cause of fire? Then what do you expect to see happen, because of that? Do you believe that Wulky Wilkinsen is a retropositional author? Then what do you expect to see because of that? No, not “alienated resublimation”; what experience will happen to you? Do you believe that if a tree falls in the forest, and no one hears it, it still makes a sound? Then what experience must therefore befall you?

It is even better to ask: what experience must not happen to you? Do you believe that élan vital explains the mysterious aliveness of living beings? Then what does this belief not allow to happen—what would definitely falsify this belief? A null answer means that your belief does not constrain experience; it permits anything to happen to you. It floats.

When you argue a seemingly factual question, always keep in mind which difference of anticipation you are arguing about. If you can’t find the difference of anticipation, you’re probably arguing about labels in your belief network—or even worse, floating beliefs, barnacles on your network. If you don’t know what experiences are implied by Wulky Wilkinsen’s writing being retropositional, you can go on arguing forever.

Above all, don’t ask what to believe—ask what to anticipate. Every question of belief should flow from a question of anticipation, and that question of anticipation should be the center of the inquiry. Every guess of belief should begin by flowing to a specific guess of anticipation, and should continue to pay rent in future anticipations. If a belief turns deadbeat, evict it.
