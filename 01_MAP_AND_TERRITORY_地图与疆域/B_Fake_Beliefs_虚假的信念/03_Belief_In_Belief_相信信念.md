## 相信信念

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

卡尔·萨根曾讲过一个[寓言](http://www.godlessgeeks.com/LINKS/Dragon.htm)：有人跑来对我们说：“我的车库里有一条龙。”多么有趣！我们说我们想去看看这条龙——让我们立刻去车库吧！“等等，”那人说，“这是一条隐形的龙。”

正如萨根指出的，这并不意味着这个假设无法证伪。也许我们去了那人的车库，虽然没看到龙，但听到了某种看不见来源的沉重呼吸声；地上神秘地出现了脚印；仪器显示车库里有什么东西在消耗氧气并呼出二氧化碳。

但假如我们对那人说：“好吧，我们去车库听听有没有沉重的呼吸声。”那人立刻说，不行，这是一条听不见的龙。我们提议测量空气中的二氧化碳，那人说龙不呼吸。我们提议往空中撒一袋面粉，看能不能勾勒出隐形龙的轮廓，那人马上说：“龙对面粉是可渗透的。”

卡尔·萨根用这个寓言来说明一个经典道理：糟糕的假说必须不断变换花样来逃避证伪。但我讲这个寓言，是为了说明另一个问题：声称者的头脑里某处一定有一个准确的情境模型，因为他们能提前预见到_究竟需要为哪些实验结果找借口_。

有些哲学家对这种情形很困惑，问道：“声称者真的相信有龙存在吗？”仿佛人脑只能存储一个信念！真实的心智比这复杂多了。信念有不同类型；并非所有信念都是直接的预期。很明显，声称者并不预期打开车库门时会看到什么异常，否则他们不会提前找借口。也许声称者的命题信念池里有一句漂浮的陈述：“我的车库里有一条龙。”理性主义者会觉得这两种信念即使类型不同，也应该冲突并碰撞。但事实上，你完全可以在一张蓝天照片旁边写上“天空是绿色的！”而纸张并不会自燃。

理性主义者的经验主义美德，正是为了防止我们犯这类错误。我们应该不断追问自己的信念会预言哪些体验，让它们在预期中“付房租”。但龙的声称者的问题更深，不是简单建议就能解决的。把“相信有龙”与“预期在车库里体验到什么”联系起来其实并不难。如果你相信车库里有龙，那么你应该预期打开门会看到龙。如果你没看到龙，那就说明车库里没有龙。这很直接。你甚至可以在自己家车库试试。

不，这种“隐形”只是更严重问题的一个症状。

根据你的童年经历，你也许记得自己第一次开始怀疑圣诞老人存在的时候，但你仍然相信自己应该相信圣诞老人，于是你试图否认自己的怀疑。正如丹尼尔·丹尼特所说，当一件事很难相信时，往往更容易相信“你应该相信它”。相信“终极宇宙天空既是完美的蓝色又是完美的绿色”是什么意思？这个说法本身就让人困惑——甚至不清楚“相信它”到底意味着什么——如果你相信，到底相信的是什么。你更容易相信“相信终极宇宙天空既是完美的蓝色又是完美的绿色”是合适的、善良的、有美德的、有益的。丹尼特把这叫做“相信信念”。<sup>1</sup>

而事情变得复杂起来，正如人类心智一贯的那样——我认为即使是丹尼特也把这种心理机制的实际运作方式简化了。首先，如果你“相信信念”，你不能承认自己只是“相信信念”。有美德的是“相信”，而不是“相信相信”；所以如果你只是“相信信念”而不是“真正相信”，你就不算有美德。没人会承认：“我不相信终极宇宙天空是蓝色和绿色的，但我相信我应该相信。”——除非他们极其善于承认自己的不够美德。人们不会“相信相信信念”，他们只会“相信信念”。

（如果你觉得这很困惑，可以去学点数理逻辑，逻辑会训练你区分命题P、P的证明、P可证的证明。同样也能区分P、想要P、相信P、想要相信P、相信你相信P。）

“相信信念”也有不同类型。你可以明确地“相信信念”；你可以在有意识的思维流中默念“相信终极宇宙天空既是完美的蓝色又是完美的绿色是有美德的”。（同时也相信自己相信这一点，除非你极其善于承认自己的不够美德。）但也有更隐晦的“相信信念”。也许龙的声称者害怕如果公开承认自己错了会被嘲笑。<sup>2</sup> 也许他们害怕承认自己其实不相信有龙，因为这与他们“我是发现龙的伟大探索者”的自我形象冲突。

如果我们所有的思想都是像哲学家那样操作的有意识语句，人类心智就容易理解多了。转瞬即逝的心象、未说出口的回避、未被承认的欲望——这些和语言一样构成了我们自己。

虽然我在一些细节和复杂性上不同意丹尼特，但我仍然认为“相信信念”这个概念是理解龙的声称者的关键洞见。但我们需要更广义的“信念”概念，不应只限于语言句子。“信念”应包括未说出口的预期控制器。“相信信念”应包括未说出口的认知-行为引导器。说“龙的声称者并不相信车库里有龙，他们只是相信相信有龙是有益的”在心理学上并不现实。但说“龙的声称者的预期表现得好像车库里没有龙，而他们的借口表现得好像他们相信信念”，则是现实的。

你完全可以脑海里有一幅没有龙的车库的普通图景，这幅图景能正确预测你打开门时的体验，而你从未在脑中想过“我的车库里没有龙”这句话。我敢打赌你也有过这种经历——当你打开车库门或卧室门时，预期不会看到龙，但脑中并没有“没有龙”这样的语言句子。

而要回避放弃对龙的信念——或回避放弃“我是相信龙的人”这个自我形象——你并不需要明确地想“我想相信我的车库里有龙”。你只需要回避承认自己其实并不相信。

如果有人既相信自己的信念，也相信龙本身，问题就没那么严重。他们愿意在实验预测上冒险，甚至可能同意如果实验预测错了就放弃信念。<sup>3</sup> 但如果有人提前编造借口，那就说明信念和相信信念已经不同步了。

<sup>2</sup> 事实上，理性主义者会祝贺他们，如果他们继续坚持有龙，反而更容易被嘲笑。

<sup>3</sup> 当然，如果信念本身并非绝对自信，“相信信念”仍然可能干扰放弃信念。

## Belief in Belief

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Carl Sagan once told a [parable](http://www.godlessgeeks.com/LINKS/Dragon.htm) 藕粉someone who comes to us and claims: “There is a dragon in my garage.” Fascinating! We reply that we wish to see this dragon—let us set out at once for the garage! “But wait,” the claimant says to us, “it is an invisible dragon.”

Now as Sagan points out, this doesn’t make the hypothesis unfalsifiable. Perhaps we go to the claimant’s garage, and although we see no dragon, we hear heavy breathing from no visible source; footprints mysteriously appear on the ground; and instruments show that something in the garage is consuming oxygen and breathing out carbon dioxide.

But now suppose that we say to the claimant, “Okay, we’ll visit the garage and see if we can hear heavy breathing,” and the claimant quickly says no, it’s an inaudible dragon. We propose to measure carbon dioxide in the air, and the claimant says the dragon does not breathe. We propose to toss a bag of flour into the air to see if it outlines an invisible dragon, and the claimant immediately says, “The dragon is permeable to flour.”

Carl Sagan used this parable to illustrate the classic moral that poor hypotheses need to do fast footwork to avoid falsification. But I tell this parable to make a different point: The claimant must have an accurate model of the situation somewhere in their mind, because they can anticipate, in advance, _exactly which experimental results they’ll need to excuse._

Some philosophers have been much confused by such scenarios, asking, “Does the claimant really believe there’s a dragon present, or not?” As if the human brain only had enough disk space to represent one belief at a time! Real minds are more tangled than that. There are different types of belief; not all beliefs are direct anticipations. The claimant clearly does not anticipate seeing anything unusual upon opening the garage door. Otherwise they wouldn’t make advance excuses. It may also be that the claimant’s pool of propositional beliefs contains the free-floating statement There is a dragon in my garage. It may seem, to a rationalist, that these two beliefs should collide and conflict even though they are of different types. Yet it is a physical fact that you can write “The sky is green!” next to a picture of a blue sky without the paper bursting into flames.

The rationalist virtue of empiricism is supposed to prevent us from making this class of mistake. We’re supposed to constantly ask our beliefs which experiences they predict, make them pay rent in anticipation. But the dragon-claimant’s problem runs deeper, and cannot be cured with such simple advice. It’s not exactly difficult to connect belief in a dragon to anticipated experience of the garage. If you believe there’s a dragon in your garage, then you can expect to open up the door and see a dragon. If you don’t see a dragon, then that means there’s no dragon in your garage. This is pretty straightforward. You can even try it with your own garage.

No, this invisibility business is a symptom of something much worse.

Depending on how your childhood went, you may remember a time period when you first began to doubt Santa Claus’s existence, but you still believed that you were supposed to believe in Santa Claus, so you tried to deny the doubts. As Daniel Dennett observes, where it is difficult to believe a thing, it is often much easier to believe that you ought to believe it. What does it mean to believe that the Ultimate Cosmic Sky is both perfectly blue and perfectly green? The statement is confusing; it’s not even clear what it would mean to believe it—what exactly would be believed, if you believed. You can much more easily believe that it is proper, that it is good and virtuous and beneficial, to believe that the Ultimate Cosmic Sky is both perfectly blue and perfectly green. Dennett calls this “belief in belief.”<sup>1</sup>

And here things become complicated, as human minds are wont to do—I think even Dennett oversimplifies how this psychology works in practice. For one thing, if you believe in belief, you cannot admit to yourself that you merely believe in belief. What’s virtuous is to believe, not to believe in believing; and so if you only believe in belief, instead of believing, you are not virtuous. Nobody will admit to themselves, “I don’t believe the Ultimate Cosmic Sky is blue and green, but I believe I ought to believe it”—not unless they are unusually capable of acknowledging their own lack of virtue. People don’t believe in belief in belief, they just believe in belief.

(Those who find this confusing may find it helpful to study mathematical logic, which trains one to make very sharp distinctions between the proposition P, a proof of P, and a proof that P is provable. There are similarly sharp distinctions between P, wanting P, believing P, wanting to believe P, and believing that you believe P.)

There are different kinds of belief in belief. You may believe in belief explicitly; you may recite in your deliberate stream of consciousness the verbal sentence “It is virtuous to believe that the Ultimate Cosmic Sky is perfectly blue and perfectly green.” (While also believing that you believe this, unless you are unusually capable of acknowledging your own lack of virtue.) But there are also less explicit forms of belief in belief. Maybe the dragon-claimant fears the public ridicule that they imagine will result if they publicly confess they were wrong.<sup>2</sup> Maybe the dragon-claimant flinches away from the prospect of admitting to themselves that there is no dragon, because it conflicts with their self-image as the glorious discoverer of the dragon, who saw in their garage what all others had failed to see.

If all our thoughts were deliberate verbal sentences like philosophers manipulate, the human mind would be a great deal easier for humans to understand. Fleeting mental images, unspoken flinches, desires acted upon without acknowledgement—these account for as much of ourselves as words.

While I disagree with Dennett on some details and complications, I still think that Dennett’s notion of belief in belief is the key insight necessary to understand the dragon-claimant. But we need a wider concept of belief, not limited to verbal sentences. “Belief” should include unspoken anticipation-controllers. “Belief in belief” should include unspoken cognitive-behavior-guiders. It is not psychologically realistic to say, “The dragon-claimant does not believe there is a dragon in their garage; they believe it is beneficial to believe there is a dragon in their garage.” But it is realistic to say the dragon-claimant anticipates as if there is no dragon in their garage, and makes excuses as if they believed in the belief.

You can possess an ordinary mental picture of your garage, with no dragons in it, which correctly predicts your experiences on opening the door, and never once think the verbal phrase There is no dragon in my garage. I even bet it’s happened to you—that when you open your garage door or bedroom door or whatever, and expect to see no dragons, no such verbal phrase runs through your mind.

And to flinch away from giving up your belief in the dragon—or flinch away from giving up your self-image as a person who believes in the dragon—it is not necessary to explicitly think I want to believe there’s a dragon in my garage. It is only necessary to flinch away from the prospect of admitting you don’t believe.

If someone believes in their belief in the dragon, and also believes in the dragon, the problem is much less severe. They will be willing to stick their neck out on experimental predictions, and perhaps even agree to give up the belief if the experimental prediction is wrong.<sup>3</sup> But when someone makes up excuses in advance, it would seem to require that belief and belief in belief have become unsynchronized.
