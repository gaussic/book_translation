## 宗教声称不可证伪

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

我所知道的最早的科学实验记载，讽刺的是，来自[以利亚与巴力祭司的故事](http://web.archive.org/web/20100312042939/http://www.nccbuscc.org/nab/bible/1kings/1kings18.htm)。

以色列民在耶和华和巴力之间摇摆不定，于是以利亚宣布要做一个实验来解决争端——在当时这是个非常新颖的概念！巴力的祭司要把他们的公牛放在祭坛上，以利亚也把耶和华的公牛放在祭坛上，但双方都不许点火；哪个神是真的，哪个神就会降下火焰烧掉祭品。巴力的祭司作为以利亚的对照组——同样的木柴、同样的公牛、同样的祭司祈祷，只不过祈祷的是假神。然后以利亚还往自己的祭坛上倒水——破坏了实验的对称性，但那是早期嘛——以此表示主动承担举证责任，就像要求0.05的显著性水平。火焰降临在以利亚的祭坛上，这就是实验观察结果。以色列民在旁边高呼“耶和华是神！”——同行评议。

然后人们把450名巴力祭司拉到基顺河边，把他们全都杀了。这很严厉，但很必要。你必须坚决地丢弃被证伪的假说，而且要迅速行动，免得它产生各种借口自我保护。如果让巴力祭司活下来，他们就会开始喋喋不休地说宗教是一个既无法证实也无法证伪的独立领域。

在过去，人们是真的相信自己的宗教，而不是仅仅“相信宗教”。那些去寻找诺亚方舟的圣经考古学家并不觉得自己是在浪费时间；他们还指望能成名。只有在找不到证据、反而发现了反证之后，宗教人士才会采取威廉·巴特利所说的“退回承诺”：“我相信，因为我相信。”

在过去，并没有宗教是“独立领域”这种概念。旧约就是一堆意识流式的文化堆积：历史、法律、道德寓言，当然还有关于宇宙如何运作的[模型](http://www.skepticfiles.org/atheist/genesisd.htm)——比如宇宙六天创造（有人说是大爆炸的隐喻），或者兔子反刍（那又是什么的隐喻……）。

在过去，如果你说本地宗教“无法被证实”，你会被活活烧死。正统犹太教的核心信仰之一就是上帝在西奈山显现，用雷霆般的声音说：“没错，这都是真的。”从贝叶斯角度看，这可是极其明确的超自然实体证据。（当然，这并不能证明那实体就是上帝本身，或者它是善意的——也可能是外星少年。）人类历史上绝大多数宗教——只有极少数是近现代才发明的——都讲述了如果真的发生过就会构成无可置疑证据的事件。宗教与事实问题的正交性，是最近且严格意义上属于西方的概念。写下原始经文的人们甚至不知道两者的区别。

罗马帝国从古希腊继承了哲学；在各省实施法律和秩序；保存官僚记录；并推行宗教宽容。新约正是在罗马帝国时期产生，因此带有一些现代性的痕迹。你不能随便编造一个上帝毁灭罗马城的故事（像所多玛和蛾摩拉那样），因为罗马历史学家会当场揭穿你，而且你也不能直接用石头砸死他们。

相比之下，编造旧约故事的人几乎可以随心所欲。早期的埃及学家发现根本没有希伯来人在埃及的任何痕迹时，真的很震惊——他们并不指望能找到十灾的记录，但至少应该有点什么。结果他们确实找到了点东西。他们发现，在所谓出埃及时期，埃及实际上统治着迦南的大部分地区。这是个巨大的历史错误，但如果没有图书馆，没人能揭穿你。

罗马帝国有图书馆。因此，新约不像旧约那样声称有大规模、轰动性的地缘政治奇迹。新约只声称一些较小的奇迹，但依然符合同样的证据框架。比如一个男孩倒地口吐白沫；原因是被污灵附体；合理预期真先知能驱逐污灵，骗子则不能；耶稣驱逐了污灵，因此耶稣是真先知而不是骗子。如果你接受癫痫是由恶魔引起的（以及癫痫发作结束就证明恶魔逃走了），这就是完全普通的贝叶斯推理。

宗教不仅曾经对事实和科学问题提出主张，宗教还曾经对一切都提出主张。宗教制定法律——在有立法机构之前；宗教记载历史——在有历史学家和考古学家之前；宗教规定性道德——在女权运动之前；宗教描述政府形式——在有宪法之前；宗教还回答了从生物分类到恒星形成等科学问题。<sup>1</sup> 现代“宗教只关乎伦理”的观念，其实是因为其他领域都被更好的制度取代了。伦理只是剩下的部分。

或者说，人们以为只剩下伦理了。想象一下2500年前的文化堆积。随着时间推移，人类会极大进步，古老文化堆积中的内容会越来越明显地过时。伦理也没有逃过人类进步——比如我们现在已经不再认可圣经允许的奴隶制。为什么人们还觉得伦理是宗教的“安全区”？

本质上，屠杀成千上万无辜的头生男婴，只为说服一个没有民选的法老释放本可瞬移出国的奴隶，这种伦理问题一点都不小。它本应比“蚂蚱有四条腿”这种科学错误更刺眼。可如果你说地球是平的，人们会觉得你疯了；但如果你说圣经是你的伦理来源，女性也不会扇你耳光。大多数人对理性的理解，取决于他们觉得自己能否蒙混过关；他们觉得可以堂而皇之地支持圣经伦理，于是只需适度自欺就能忽略圣经的道德问题。大家都默契地不去注意客厅里的大象，这种状态还能维持一阵子。

也许有一天，人类会更进一步，任何支持圣经作为伦理来源的人都会像特伦特·洛特支持斯特罗姆·瑟蒙德竞选总统那样被对待。到那时，人们会说宗教的“真正核心”其实一直是家谱之类的东西。

“宗教是一个无法证实也无法证伪的独立领域”这个观念，是一个弥天大谎——一个被反复重复、让人不假思索地说出口的谎言；但只要认真审视，就会发现它完全是假的。它极大歪曲了宗教的历史起源、所有经典的表达方式、儿童被说服的方式，以及地球上大多数宗教信徒的真实信仰。你不得不佩服这种谎言的厚颜无耻，堪比“欧亚国一直在与东亚国交战”。检察官掏出带血的斧头，被告人一时愣住，赶紧说：“但你不能用证据来否定我的清白——这是独立领域！”

如果这还不行，就随手拿张纸，给自己画一张“免罪卡”吧。

<sup>1</sup> 旧约并没有谈论对宇宙复杂性的敬畏，也许是因为它太忙于规定“穿男装的女人要处死”之类的内容了，这才是那个时代实在又令人满足的宗教内容。

## Religion’s Claim to be Non-Disprovable

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

The earliest account I know of a scientific experiment is, ironically, the story of [Elijah and the priests of Baal](http://web.archive.org/web/20100312042939/http://www.nccbuscc.org/nab/bible/1kings/1kings18.htm).

The people of Israel are wavering between Jehovah and Baal, so Elijah announces that he will conduct an experiment to settle it—quite a novel concept in those days! The priests of Baal will place their bull on an altar, and Elijah will place Jehovah’s bull on an altar, but neither will be allowed to start the fire; whichever God is real will call down fire on His sacrifice. The priests of Baal serve as control group for Elijah—the same wooden fuel, the same bull, and the same priests making invocations, but to a false god. Then Elijah pours water on his altar—ruining the experimental symmetry, but this was back in the early days—to signify deliberate acceptance of the burden of proof, like needing a 0.05 significance level. The fire comes down on Elijah’s altar, which is the experimental observation. The watching people of Israel shout “The Lord is God!”—peer review.

And then the people haul the 450 priests of Baal down to the river Kishon and slit their throats. This is stern, but necessary. You must firmly discard the falsified hypothesis, and do so swiftly, before it can generate excuses to protect itself. If the priests of Baal are allowed to survive, they will start babbling about how religion is a separate magisterium which can be neither proven nor disproven.

Back in the old days, people actually believed their religions instead of just believing in them. The biblical archaeologists who went in search of Noah’s Ark did not think they were wasting their time; they anticipated they might become famous. Only after failing to find confirming evidence—and finding disconfirming evidence in its place—did religionists execute what William Bartley called the retreat to commitment, “I believe because I believe.”

Back in the old days, there was no concept of religion’s being a separate magisterium. The Old Testament is a stream-of-consciousness culture dump: history, law, moral parables, and yes, [models](http://www.skepticfiles.org/atheist/genesisd.htm) of how the universe works—like the universe being created in six days (which is a metaphor for the Big Bang), or rabbits chewing their cud. (Which is a metaphor for . . .)

Back in the old days, saying the local religion “could not be proven” would have gotten you burned at the stake. One of the core beliefs of Orthodox Judaism is that God appeared at Mount Sinai and said in a thundering voice, “Yeah, it’s all true.” From a Bayesian perspective that’s some darned unambiguous evidence of a superhumanly powerful entity. (Although it doesn’t prove that the entity is God per se, or that the entity is benevolent—it could be alien teenagers.) The vast majority of religions in human history—excepting only those invented extremely recently—tell stories of events that would constitute completely unmistakable evidence if they’d actually happened. The orthogonality of religion and factual questions is a recent and strictly Western concept. The people who wrote the original scriptures didn’t even know the difference.

The Roman Empire inherited philosophy from the ancient Greeks; imposed law and order within its provinces; kept bureaucratic records; and enforced religious tolerance. The New Testament, created during the time of the Roman Empire, bears some traces of modernity as a result. You couldn’t invent a story about God completely obliterating the city of Rome (a la Sodom and Gomorrah), because the Roman historians would call you on it, and you couldn’t just stone them.

In contrast, the people who invented the Old Testament stories could make up pretty much anything they liked. Early Egyptologists were genuinely shocked to find no trace whatsoever of Hebrew tribes having ever been in Egypt—they weren’t expecting to find a record of the Ten Plagues, but they expected to find something. As it turned out, they did find something. They found out that, during the supposed time of the Exodus, Egypt ruled much of Canaan. That’s one huge historical error, but if there are no libraries, nobody can call you on it.

The Roman Empire did have libraries. Thus, the New Testament doesn’t claim big, showy, large-scale geopolitical miracles as the Old Testament routinely did. Instead the New Testament claims smaller miracles which nonetheless fit into the same framework of evidence. A boy falls down and froths at the mouth; the cause is an unclean spirit; an unclean spirit could reasonably be expected to flee from a true prophet, but not to flee from a charlatan; Jesus casts out the unclean spirit; therefore Jesus is a true prophet and not a charlatan. This is perfectly ordinary Bayesian reasoning, if you grant the basic premise that epilepsy is caused by demons (and that the end of an epileptic fit proves the demon fled).

Not only did religion used to make claims about factual and scientific matters, religion used to make claims about everything. Religion laid down a code of law—before legislative bodies; religion laid down history—before historians and archaeologists; religion laid down the sexual morals—before Women’s Lib; religion described the forms of government—before constitutions; and religion answered scientific questions from biological taxonomy to the formation of stars.<sup>1</sup> The modern concept of religion as purely ethical derives from every other area’s having been taken over by better institutions. Ethics is what’s left.

Or rather, people think ethics is what’s left. Take a culture dump from 2,500 years ago. Over time, humanity will progress immensely, and pieces of the ancient culture dump will become ever more glaringly obsolete. Ethics has not been immune to human progress—for example, we now frown upon such Bible-approved practices as keeping slaves. Why do people think that ethics is still fair game?

Intrinsically, there’s nothing small about the ethical problem with slaughtering thousands of innocent first-born male children to convince an unelected Pharaoh to release slaves who logically could have been teleported out of the country. It should be more glaring than the comparatively trivial scientific error of saying that grasshoppers have four legs. And yet, if you say the Earth is flat, people will look at you like you’re crazy. But if you say the Bible is your source of ethics, women will not slap you. Most people’s concept of rationality is determined by what they think they can get away with; they think they can get away with endorsing Bible ethics; and so it only requires a manageable effort of self-deception for them to overlook the Bible’s moral problems. Everyone has agreed not to notice the elephant in the living room, and this state of affairs can sustain itself for a time.

Maybe someday, humanity will advance further, and anyone who endorses the Bible as a source of ethics will be treated the same way as Trent Lott endorsing Strom Thurmond’s presidential campaign. And then it will be said that religion’s “true core” has always been genealogy or something.

The idea that religion is a separate magisterium that cannot be proven or disproven is a Big Lie—a lie which is repeated over and over again, so that people will say it without thinking; yet which is, on critical examination, simply false. It is a wild distortion of how religion happened historically, of how all scriptures present their beliefs, of what children are told to persuade them, and of what the majority of religious people on Earth still believe. You have to admire its sheer brazenness, on a par with Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia. The prosecutor whips out the bloody axe, and the defendant, momentarily shocked, thinks quickly and says: “But you can’t disprove my innocence by mere evidence—it’s a separate magisterium!”

And if that doesn’t work, grab a piece of paper and scribble yourself a Get Out of Jail Free card.

<sup>1</sup>The Old Testament doesn't talk about a sense of wonder at the complexity of the universe, perhaps because it was too busy laying down the death penalty for women who wore mens clothing, which was solid and satisfying religious content of that era.
