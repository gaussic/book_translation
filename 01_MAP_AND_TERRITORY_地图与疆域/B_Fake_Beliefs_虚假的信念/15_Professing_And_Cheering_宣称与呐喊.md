## 宣称与呐喊

我曾参加过一个主题为“科学与宗教是否兼容？”的讨论小组。小组里有一位女性，是异教徒，她滔滔不绝地讲述自己相信地球的起源：一头巨大的原初母牛诞生于原初深渊，舔出了一个原初神，这个神的后代杀死了一个原初巨人，并用其尸体创造了地球，等等。这个故事冗长、细节繁多，甚至比“地球由一只巨龟背负”还要荒诞。而且很明显，这位讲者懂得足够多的科学知识，知道这一切有多么荒谬。

至今我仍难以用语言描述当时看到的情景。她说话时带着……自豪？自鸣得意？还是一种刻意的张扬？

这位女士讲述她的创世神话，仿佛过了很久，其实可能只有五分钟。那种奇特的自豪/满足/张扬，显然与她知道自己的信仰在科学上极其荒谬有关。而且她并不讨厌科学；作为小组成员，她还宣称宗教与科学是兼容的。她甚至谈到，考虑到维京人所处的环境，他们谈论原初深渊是可以理解的——她甚至为自己的宗教找理由！——但她仍然坚持说这就是她“相信”的，用一种奇特的满足语气说出来。

我不确定丹尼尔·丹尼特提出的“相信信念”这个概念是否能涵盖这种现象。那比这还要奇怪。她讲述创世神话时，并没有表现出那种需要自我安慰的狂热信仰。她也没有表现出希望我们这些听众被说服，或者需要我们的信仰来证明她的信仰。

丹尼特除了提出“相信信念”这个概念外，还建议许多所谓的“宗教信仰”其实应该被当作“宗教宣称”来研究。假设有个外星人类学家研究一群英国学生，这些学生似乎都相信 Wulky Wilkensen 是一位逆向定位作家。合适的问题也许不是“为什么这些学生都相信这个奇怪的信念？”，而是“为什么他们都在测验上写下这句奇怪的话？”即使一句话本质上毫无意义，你也能知道什么时候该大声背诵出来。

我认为丹尼特把宗教宣称仅仅等同于口头表达信仰，可能有点太愤世嫉俗了——大多数人还是足够诚实的，如果他们大声说出一句宗教陈述，也会觉得有义务在自己的意识流中默念这句话。

但即使是“宗教宣称”这个概念，似乎也无法涵盖那位异教女士声称相信原初母牛的情形。如果你必须宣称某种宗教信仰来取悦神职人员、取悦同教徒——甚至取悦你作为宗教人士的自我形象——你都得比这位女士表现得更像真的相信。她讲述原初母牛的故事时，甚至没有试图在这方面表现得有说服力——甚至没有试图让我们相信她自己是认真的。我想这正是让我感到震惊的地方。我认识一些人，他们相信自己相信荒谬的东西，但当他们宣称这些信仰时，会花更多力气让自己相信自己是认真的。

我终于意识到，这位女士既不是想说服我们，也不是想说服自己。她讲述创世故事，其实根本不是在讲世界的起源。相反，她用五分钟的时间大谈原初母牛，其实是在为异教呐喊，就像在足球比赛上举起一面横幅。写着“蓝队加油！”的横幅并不是事实陈述，也不是试图说服谁；它不需要有说服力——它就是一种呐喊。

那种奇特的张扬自豪……就像她在骄傲游行中裸身游行<sup>1</sup>。这不仅仅是呐喊，就像游行一样，更像是一种极端的呐喊，就像裸身游行——她相信自己不会被逮捕或批评，因为她是在为自己的骄傲游行而这样做。

这也就是为什么她说的内容越荒谬，对她来说反而越重要。如果她试图让它听起来更合理，那就像是给自己穿上了衣服。

<sup>1</sup>当然，实际上在骄傲游行中裸身游行并没有什么错；这不是事实真相能摧毁的东西。

## Professing and Cheering

I once attended a panel on the topic, “Are science and religion compatible?” One of the women on the panel, a pagan, held forth interminably upon how she believed that the Earth had been created when a giant primordial cow was born into the primordial abyss, who licked a primordial god into existence, whose descendants killed a primordial giant and used its corpse to create the Earth, etc. The tale was long, and detailed, and more absurd than the Earth being supported on the back of a giant turtle. And the speaker clearly knew enough science to know this.

I still find myself struggling for words to describe what I saw as this woman spoke. She spoke with . . . pride? Self-satisfaction? A deliberate flaunting of herself?

The woman went on describing her creation myth for what seemed like forever, but was probably only five minutes. That strange pride/satisfaction/flaunting clearly had something to do with her knowing that her beliefs were scientifically outrageous. And it wasn’t that she hated science; as a panelist she professed that religion and science were compatible. She even talked about how it was quite understandable that the Vikings talked about a primordial abyss, given the land in which they lived—explained away her own religion!—and yet nonetheless insisted this was what she “believed,” said with peculiar satisfaction.

I’m not sure that Daniel Dennett’s concept of “belief in belief” stretches to cover this event. It was weirder than that. She didn’t recite her creation myth with the fanatical faith of someone who needs to reassure herself. She didn’t act like she expected us, the audience, to be convinced—or like she needed our belief to validate her.

Dennett, in addition to introducing the idea of belief in belief, has also suggested that much of what is called “religious belief” should really be studied as “religious profession” instead. Suppose an alien anthropologist studied a group of English students who all seemingly believed that Wulky Wilkensen was a retropositional author. The appropriate question may not be “Why do the students all believe this strange belief?” but “Why do they all write this strange sentence on quizzes?” Even if a sentence is essentially meaningless, you can still know when you are supposed to chant the response aloud.

I think Dennett may be slightly too cynical in suggesting that religious profession is just saying the belief aloud—most people are honest enough that, if they say a religious statement aloud, they will also feel obligated to say the verbal sentence into their own stream of consciousness.

But even the concept of “religious profession” doesn’t seem to cover the pagan woman’s claim to believe in the primordial cow. If you had to profess a religious belief to satisfy a priest, or satisfy a co-religionist—heck, to satisfy your own self-image as a religious person—you would have to pretend to believe much more convincingly than this woman was doing. As she recited her tale of the primordial cow, she wasn’t even trying to be persuasive on that front—wasn’t even trying to convince us that she took her own religion seriously. I think that’s the part that so took me aback. I know people who believe they believe ridiculous things, but when they profess them, they’ll spend much more effort to convince themselves that they take their beliefs seriously.

It finally occurred to me that this woman wasn’t trying to convince us or even convince herself. Her recitation of the creation story wasn’t about the creation of the world at all. Rather, by launching into a five-minute diatribe about the primordial cow, she was cheering for paganism, like holding up a banner at a football game. A banner saying GO BLUES isn’t a statement of fact, or an attempt to persuade; it doesn’t have to be convincing—it’s a cheer.

That strange flaunting pride . . . it was like she was marching naked in a gay pride parade.<sup>1</sup> It wasn’t just a cheer, like marching, but an outrageous cheer, like marching naked—believing that she couldn’t be arrested or criticized, because she was doing it for her pride parade.

That’s why it mattered to her that what she was saying was beyond ridiculous. If she’d tried to make it sound more plausible, it would have been like putting on clothes.

<sup>1</sup>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with actually marching naked in pride parades; this isn’t something that truth can destroy.
