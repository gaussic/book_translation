信念是有量化程度的。正如有人会做出比自己实际预期更自信的断言，也有人会做出比自己实际预期更缺乏信心的断言。你可以披上不确定的外衣，或者宣称一种其实并不存在的不可知论。在这里，我要特别指出一种不当的不确定性：为了表现成熟、公正或居高临下的视角，而故意表现出中立或悬而未决的态度。

比如，我的父母在面对神学问题时，比如“为什么古埃及在许多方面都有良好记录，却没有任何关于犹太人曾经在那里出现的记录？”他们会回答：“哦，我在你这个年纪时也会问这种问题，但现在我已经长大了。”

再比如，校长面对两个在操场上打架的孩子时，严厉地说：“谁先动手不重要，重要的是谁结束了这场打斗。”当然，谁先动手很重要。校长也许无法获得关于这个关键事实的准确信息，但如果是这样，校长应该如实说明，而不是否认谁先动手的重要性。让家长去打校长一拳，看看“谁先动手不重要”在法官面前能走多远。但对成年人来说，孩子打架只是件麻烦事，至于是谁先动手，对他们的便利毫无影响。他们只关心打架能尽快结束。

类似的动态也出现在国际外交中，大国严厉地要求小国“立刻停止打斗”。对大国来说，谁先挑衅、谁反应过度并不重要，因为大国的不便只取决于冲突是否持续。哦，以色列和哈马斯就不能好好相处吗？

我把这称为“假装睿智”。当然，表现睿智有很多方式。但如果你试图通过拒绝猜测、拒绝总结证据、拒绝做出判断、拒绝选边站队、保持超然并用高高在上的目光俯视一切——也就是说，通过什么都不说、什么都不做来表现睿智——我觉得这尤其做作。

保罗·弗雷雷说过：“对强者与弱者之间的冲突洗手不管，就是站在强者一边，而不是中立。”<sup>1</sup> 如果老师不关心谁先动手，操场就是欺凌者的天堂、受害者的地狱。同样，在国际政治中：如果大国拒绝选边，只要求立即停火，这个世界对侵略者来说再好不过，对被侵略者来说则极其糟糕。当然，这对大国或校长来说却非常方便。所以，这种行为有一部分可以归因于“睿智者”的自私。

但其中也有一部分是为了展示自己居高临下的视角。毕竟——如果一个校长在孩子打架时真的选边站队，其他成年人会怎么看？这会让校长的地位降为普通参与者！

同样，那些受人尊敬的长者——无论是CEO、著名学者还是邮件列表的创始人——他们的公正声誉正是建立在他们拒绝自己做出判断之上。当别人选边时，他们被请求支持，但几乎总是徒劳；因为“睿智者”之所以受人尊敬，正是因为他们几乎从不真正做出裁决——否则他们就只是争吵中的又一个普通参与者而已。<sup>2</sup>

当然，有些情况下，悬而未决是理性的，因为人们往往因偏见而过早下结论。正如迈克尔·鲁尼所说：

    这里的错误类似于我在初学哲学的学生中常见的：当他们面对怀疑主义理由时，会变成相对主义者。也就是说，当理性的结论是对某个问题保持判断时，太多人却得出“任何判断都一样合理”的结论。

但我们如何避免另一种（相关但不同的）伪理性行为——通过虚假宣称当前证据均衡来表现自己的公正无私？比如：“当然，达尔文主义者很激进，但我认为我们现有的证据还不足以明确支持自然选择优于智能设计。”

在这一点上，我建议记住：中立本身就是一种明确的判断。它不是超然于一切之上，而是明确地表达了“在这个具体案例中，证据的平衡只允许得出一个结论，那就是中立”。这种信念同样必须在预期体验上“付房租”，而且它也可能是错的；宣称中立和宣称任何一方一样，都可以被质疑。

政策问题也是如此。如果有人说“支持生命权”和“支持选择权”双方都有道理，大家应该多妥协、互相尊重，这并不是超越堕胎辩论两方的立场，而是提出了一个明确的判断，与直接说“支持生命权！”或“支持选择权！”一样具体。

在理性训练中，或许一开始可以避免用堕胎或以巴冲突这类议题练习，先在情感负担较轻的话题上积累经验。但这并不是说理性主义者太成熟而不谈政治，也不是说理性主义者高高在上，只有政党分子和年轻人才会参与这种愚蠢的争论。

正如罗宾·汉森所说，能够进行有分歧的对话是一种有限资源。如果你能想出“横向拉绳”的方法，你就有理由把有限资源用在那些边际讨论收益更高、但不那么常见的话题上。<sup>3</sup>

但你选择不优先处理的责任，只是因为你的资源有限，而不是因为你高高在上、超然睿智。

总之，以下几者是有区别的：

- 做出中立判断；
- 不愿投入边际资源；
- 假装上述任何一种是深刻智慧、成熟和高人一等的标志，并暗示原本的争论双方都处于低等、无足轻重的位置。

<sup>2</sup> 有趣的是，现实法律体系中的法官可以反复做出真实裁决，却不会自动失去公正声誉。也许是因为大家都默认他们必须裁决，这是他们的职责。或者因为法官不必反复裁决那些会分裂他们赖以获得尊敬的部落的问题。

## Pretending to be Wise

Belief is quantitative, and just as it is possible to make overconfident assertions relative to one’s anticipations, it is possible to make underconfident assertions relative to one’s anticipations. One can wear the attire of uncertainty, or profess an agnosticism that isn’t really there. Here, I’ll single out a special case of improper uncertainty: the display of neutrality or suspended judgment in order to signal maturity, impartiality, or a superior vantage point.

An example would be the case of my parents, who respond to theological questions like “Why does ancient Egypt, which had good records on many other matters, lack any records of Jews having ever been there?” with “Oh, when I was your age, I also used to ask that sort of question, but now I’ve grown out of it.”

Another example would be the principal who, faced with two children who were caught fighting on the playground, sternly says: “It doesn’t matter who started the fight, it only matters who ends it.” Of course it matters who started the fight. The principal may not have access to good information about this critical fact, but if so, the principal should say so, not dismiss the importance of who threw the first punch. Let a parent try punching the principal, and we’ll see how far “It doesn’t matter who started it” gets in front of a judge. But to adults it is just inconvenient that children fight, and it matters not at all to their convenience which child started it. It is only convenient that the fight end as rapidly as possible.

A similar dynamic, I believe, governs the occasions in international diplomacy where Great Powers sternly tell smaller groups to stop that fighting right now. It doesn’t matter to the Great Power who started it—who provoked, or who responded disproportionately to provocation—because the Great Power’s ongoing inconvenience is only a function of the ongoing conflict. Oh, can’t Israel and Hamas just get along?

This I call “pretending to be Wise.” Of course there are many ways to try and signal wisdom. But trying to signal wisdom by refusing to make guesses—refusing to sum up evidence—refusing to pass judgment—refusing to take sides—staying above the fray and looking down with a lofty and condescending gaze—which is to say, signaling wisdom by saying and doing nothing—well, that I find particularly pretentious.

Paolo Freire said, “Washing one’s hands of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless means to side with the powerful, not to be neutral.”<sup>1</sup> A playground is a great place to be a bully, and a terrible place to be a victim, if the teachers don’t care who started it. And likewise in international politics: A world where the Great Powers refuse to take sides and only demand immediate truces is a great world for aggressors and a terrible place for the aggressed. But, of course, it is a very convenient world in which to be a Great Power or a school principal. So part of this behavior can be chalked up to sheer selfishness on the part of the Wise.

But part of it also has to do with signaling a superior vantage point. After all—what would the other adults think of a principal who actually seemed to be taking sides in a fight between mere children? Why, it would lower the principal’s status to a mere participant in the fray!

Similarly with the revered elder—who might be a CEO, a prestigious academic, or a founder of a mailing list—whose reputation for fairness depends on their refusal to pass judgment themselves, when others are choosing sides. Sides appeal to them for support, but almost always in vain; for the Wise are revered judges on the condition that they almost never actually judge—then they would just be another disputant in the fray, no better than any mere arguer.<sup>2</sup>

There are cases where it is rational to suspend judgment, where people leap to judgment only because of their biases. As Michael Rooney said:

	The error here is similar to one I see all the time in beginning philosophy students: when confronted with reasons to be skeptics, they instead become relativists. That is, when the rational conclusion is to suspend judgment about an issue, all too many people instead conclude that any judgment is as plausible as any other.

But then how can we avoid the (related but distinct) pseudo-rationalist behavior of signaling your unbiased impartiality by falsely claiming that the current balance of evidence is neutral? “Oh, well, of course you have a lot of passionate Darwinists out there, but I think the evidence we have doesn’t really enable us to make a definite endorsement of natural selection over intelligent design.”

On this point I’d advise remembering that neutrality is a definite judgment. It is not staying above anything. It is putting forth the definite and particular position that the balance of evidence in a particular case licenses only one summation, which happens to be neutral. This belief, too, must pay rent in anticipated experiences, and it can be wrong; propounding neutrality is just as attackable as propounding any particular side.

Likewise with policy questions. If someone says that both pro-life and pro-choice sides have good points and that they really should try to compromise and respect each other more, they are not taking a position above the two standard sides in the abortion debate. They are putting forth a definite judgment, every bit as particular as saying “pro-life!” or “pro-choice!”

It may be useful to initially avoid using issues like abortion or the IsraeliPalestinian conflict for your rationality practice, and so build up skill on less emotionally charged topics. But it’s not that a rationalist is too mature to talk about politics. It’s not that a rationalist is above this foolish fray in which only mere political partisans and youthful enthusiasts would stoop to participate.

As Robin Hanson describes it, the ability to have potentially divisive conversations is a limited resource. If you can think of ways to pull the rope sideways, you are justified in expending your limited resources on relatively less common issues where marginal discussion offers relatively higher marginal payoffs.<sup>3</sup>

But then the responsibilities that you deprioritize are a matter of your limited resources. Not a matter of floating high above, serene and Wise.

In sum, there’s a difference between:

- Passing neutral judgment;
- Declining to invest marginal resources;
- Pretending that either of the above is a mark of deep wisdom, maturity, and a superior vantage point; with the corresponding implication that the original sides occupy lower vantage points that are not importantly different from up there.

<sup>2</sup>Oddly, judges in the actual legal system can repeatedly hand down real verdicts without automatically losing their reputation for impartiality. Maybe because of the understood norm that they have to judge, that it’s their job. Or maybe because judges don’t have to repeatedly rule on issues that have split a tribe on which they depend for their reverence.
