## 聚焦你的不确定性

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

债券收益率会升高、降低，还是保持不变？如果你是一名电视评论员，你的工作就是事后解释结果，那你完全不用担心。无论三种可能中的哪一种发生，你都能解释为什么结果完美契合你钟爱的市场理论。你没必要把这三种可能性看作互相对立或互斥的，因为无论发生哪种结果，你都能获得满分的评论表现。

但等等！假如你是个新手电视评论员，还没有足够的经验能当场编出合理的解释。你需要提前为明天的节目准备发言稿，而你的准备时间有限。在这种情况下，如果你能提前知道哪种结果会真正发生——债券收益率会上升、下降还是保持不变——那你只需要准备一套说辞就够了。

可惜，没有人能真正预见未来。那你该怎么办？你当然不能用“概率”。我们都[从学校](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i2/two_more_things_to_unlearn_from_school/)知道，“概率”是出现在应用题旁边的小数字，而这里并没有这些小数字。更糟糕的是，你感到不确定。你不记得在处理应用题里的小数字时有过这种不确定的感觉。大学里的数学课环境干净整洁，所以数学似乎无法应用到那些不那么整洁的现实生活情境中。你也不想不恰当地[把一种情境下的思维技能迁移到另一种情境](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/Crit_Thinking.pdf)。很明显，这不是“概率”能解决的问题。

尽管如此，你只有 100 分钟来准备你的说辞。你不能把全部 100 分钟都花在“上涨”上，同时又把全部 100 分钟都花在“下跌”或“持平”上。你必须以某种方式进行优先排序。

如果你需要向评审委员会解释你的时间分配，你就得在每种可能性上花同样多的时间。因为没有写下任何小数字，你也没有文件证明自己为什么要花不同的时间。你仿佛能听到评审们质问：“Finkledinger 先生，你为什么在第 3 个借口上花了正好 42 分钟？为什么不是 41 分钟，或者 43 分钟？承认吧——你不客观！你在主观偏袒！”

但你会松一口气地意识到，这里没有评审委员会会责备你。这很好，因为明天联邦储备委员会有重大公告，债券价格保持不变的可能性似乎很小。你不想在一个你根本不打算用到的借口上浪费 33 分钟宝贵时间。

你的思绪总会飘回到你在电视上用过的那些解释——为什么每个事件都能合理地契合你的市场理论。但很快你就会发现，这种合理性在这里帮不上忙——三种结果都很合理。你的市场理论适配性并不能告诉你该如何分配时间。你的 100 分钟时间是有限的，而你为每种结果编造解释的能力却是无限的，这两者之间有一道无法跨越的鸿沟。

然而……即使在你不确定的状态下，你似乎对这三种事件的预期并不一样；你觉得有些借口比其他的更可能用得上。最有趣的是——当你想到某个因素让债券价格上涨的可能性更大时，你就觉得自己不太需要为债券价格下跌或持平准备借口。

甚至似乎你对每种结果的预期程度，和你想为每个借口准备多少时间之间存在某种关系。当然，这种关系其实无法量化。你有 100 分钟来准备发言稿，但在“预期”这件事上并没有 100 个什么可以分配。（虽然你确实算出来，如果某个特定结果发生，那么你在准备该借口上花的时间带来的效用是对数型的。）

尽管如此……你的思绪总会回到这样一个想法：预期是有限的，和借口不同，倒是和准备借口的时间一样。也许预期应该被当作一种守恒资源，就像金钱一样。你的第一反应是想获得更多的预期，但你很快意识到，即使你获得了更多的预期，你也不会有更多时间来准备借口。不，你唯一能做的就是尽可能合理地分配你有限的预期资源。

你很确定在统计课上没人教过你这些。他们没告诉你在极度不确定时该怎么办，也没告诉你在没有小数字可用时该怎么办。甚至就算你试图用数字，也可能用上各种各样的数字——根本没有提示你该用什么数学！也许你会用上一对对的数字，左边一个右边一个，叫做 DS（Dexter-Sinister）……谁知道还会用什么？（不过你确实只有 100 分钟来准备借口。）

要是有一种艺术，能让你聚焦自己的不确定性——把尽可能多的预期集中到真正会发生的结果上，那该多好！

但我们该怎么称呼这种艺术？它的规则又会是什么样的呢？

## Focus Your Uncertainty

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Will bond yields go up, or down, or remain the same? If you’re a TV pundit and your job is to explain the outcome after the fact, then there’s no reason to worry. No matter which of the three possibilities comes true, you’ll be able to explain why the outcome perfectly fits your pet market theory. There’s no reason to think of these three possibilities as somehow opposed to one another, as exclusive, because you’ll get full marks for punditry no matter which outcome occurs.

But wait! Suppose you’re a novice TV pundit, and you aren’t experienced enough to make up plausible explanations on the spot. You need to prepare remarks in advance for tomorrow’s broadcast, and you have limited time to prepare. In this case, it would be helpful to know which outcome will actually occur—whether bond yields will go up, down, or remain the same—because then you would only need to prepare one set of excuses.

Alas, no one can possibly foresee the future. What are you to do? You certainly can’t use “probabilities.” We all [know from sc]hool](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i2/two_more_things_to_unlearn_from_school/) that “probabilities” are little numbers that appear next to a word problem, and there aren’t any little numbers here. Worse, you feel uncertain. You don’t remember feeling uncertain while you were manipulating the little numbers in word problems. College classes teaching math are nice clean places, so math can’t apply to life situations that aren’t nice and clean. You wouldn’t want to inappropriately [transfer thinking skills from one context to another](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/Crit_Thinking.pdf). Clearly, this is not a matter for “probabilities.”

Nonetheless, you only have 100 minutes to prepare your excuses. You can’t spend the entire 100 minutes on “up,” and also spend all 100 minutes on “down,” and also spend all 100 minutes on “same.” You’ve got to prioritize somehow.

If you needed to justify your time expenditure to a review committee, you would have to spend equal time on each possibility. Since there are no little numbers written down, you’d have no documentation to justify spending different amounts of time. You can hear the reviewers now: _And why, Mr. Finkledinger, did you spend exactly 42 minutes on excuse #3? Why not 41 minutes, or 43? Admit it—you’re not being objective! You’re playing subjective favorites!_

But, you realize with a small flash of relief, there’s no review committee to scold you. This is good, because there’s a major Federal Reserve announcement tomorrow, and it seems unlikely that bond prices will remain the same. You don’t want to spend 33 precious minutes on an excuse you don’t anticipate needing.

Your mind keeps drifting to the explanations you use on television, of why each event plausibly fits your market theory. But it rapidly becomes clear that plausibility can’t help you here—all three events are plausible. Fittability to your pet market theory doesn’t tell you how to divide your time. There’s an uncrossable gap between your 100 minutes of time, which are conserved; versus your ability to explain how an outcome fits your theory, which is unlimited.

And yet . . . even in your uncertain state of mind, it seems that you anticipate the three events differently; that you expect to need some excuses more than others. And—this is the fascinating part—when you think of something that makes it seem more likely that bond prices will go up, then you feel less likely to need an excuse for bond prices going down or remaining the same.

It even seems like there’s a relation between how much you anticipate each of the three outcomes, and how much time you want to spend preparing each excuse. Of course the relation can’t actually be quantified. You have 100 minutes to prepare your speech, but there isn’t 100 of anything to divide up in this anticipation business. (Although you do work out that, if some particular outcome occurs, then your utility function is logarithmic in time spent preparing the excuse.)

Still . . . your mind keeps coming back to the idea that anticipation is limited, unlike excusability, but like time to prepare excuses. Maybe anticipation should be treated as a conserved resource, like money. Your first impulse is to try to get more anticipation, but you soon realize that, even if you get more anticipation, you won’t have any more time to prepare your excuses. No, your only course is to allocate your limited supply of anticipation as best you can.

You’re pretty sure you weren’t taught anything like that in your statistics courses. They didn’t tell you what to do when you felt so terribly uncertain. They didn’t tell you what to do when there were no little numbers handed to you. Why, even if you tried to use numbers, you might end up using any sort of numbers at all—there’s no hint what kind of math to use, if you should be using math! Maybe you’d end up using pairs of numbers, right and left numbers, which you’d call DS for Dexter-Sinister . . . or who knows what else? (Though you do have only 100 minutes to spend preparing excuses.)

If only there were an art of focusing your uncertainty—of squeezing as much anticipation as possible into whichever outcome will actually happen!

But what could we call an art like that? And what would the rules be like?
