## 期望证据守恒定律

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

弗里德里希·斯佩·冯·兰根费尔德（Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld）是一位为被判女巫的女性听忏悔的神父，他在1631年写下了《刑事案件的谨慎》（Cautio Criminalis），辛辣地描述了定罪女巫的决策树：如果女巫过着邪恶不正当的生活，她有罪；如果她过着善良正当的生活，这同样是证据，因为女巫会伪装，努力表现得特别有美德。女人被关进监狱后：如果她害怕，这证明她有罪；如果她不害怕，这也证明她有罪，因为女巫通常会假装无辜，表现得很大胆。又比如听说有人指控她施巫术，她可能选择逃跑或留下；如果她逃跑，这证明她有罪；如果她留下，则是魔鬼让她无法逃脱。

斯佩作为许多女巫的忏悔神父，因此有机会观察到指控树的每一个分支——无论被指控的女巫说什么、做什么，都会被当作对她不利的证据。而在任何单独的案件中，你只会听到困境的一个分支。这也是科学家们事先写下实验预测的原因。

但你不能两头都占——这不仅仅是公平问题，而是概率论的问题。“缺乏证据就是缺乏存在的证据”这条规则，其实是更一般规律的特例，我称之为“期望证据守恒定律”：在看到证据之后，后验概率的期望必须等于先验概率。

> P(H) = P(H)
> P(H) = P(H,E) + P(H,~E)
> P(H) = P(H|E)*P(E) + P(H|~E)*P(~E)

因此，每一个证据的期望，都有一个大小相等、方向相反的反证据期望。

如果你预期很大概率会看到某个方向上的微弱证据，那就必须以很小概率看到另一个方向上的强烈证据来平衡。如果你对自己的理论非常自信，因此预期会看到与你假设相符的结果，这只能让你的信念增加很小一点（因为已经接近1）；但如果预测失败（出现意外结果），那就会（而且必须）对你的信心造成巨大打击。平均而言，你最终的信心必须和最初一样。换句话说，在你真正看到证据之前，单凭“预期会遇到证据”本身，不应改变你的先验信念。

所以，如果你声称“没有破坏”是日裔美国人“第五纵队”存在的证据，那么你也必须承认，如果真的看到破坏行为，那就反而是反对“第五纵队”存在的证据。如果你说“善良正当的生活”是女人是女巫的证据，那么“邪恶不正当的生活”就必须是她不是女巫的证据。如果你主张上帝为了考验人类的信仰而拒绝显现自己，那么圣经中记载的奇迹就必须成为反对上帝存在的证据。

这听起来有点不对劲，对吧？请注意你脑海中那种“好像有点牵强”的感觉，那种隐隐的紧张感。这很重要。

对于真正的贝叶斯主义者来说，想要寻找“证实”某个理论的证据是不可能的。你无法设计出任何计划、策略或巧妙手段，让你对某个固定命题的信心（平均而言）比之前更高。你只能寻找证据来检验理论，而不是证实它。

明白这一点会让你轻松不少。你不必担心如何解释每一个可能的实验结果来证实你的理论。你也不必费心计划如何让每一丝证据都支持你的理论，因为你知道，每一个证据的期望，都有一个大小相等、方向相反的反证据期望。如果你试图削弱某个“异常”观测的反证据作用，你只能以等量削弱“正常”观测的支持作用来交换。这是一个零和游戏。无论你怎么算计、怎么辩解、怎么谋划，都不可能让你的整体计划（平均而言）让信念朝某个方向偏移。

你大可以放松下来，静静等待证据到来。

……人类心理真是太混乱了。

## Conservation of Expected Evidence

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld, a priest who heard the confessions of condemned witches, wrote in 1631 the Cautio Criminalis (“prudence in criminal cases”), in which he bitingly described the decision tree for condemning accused witches: If the witch had led an evil and improper life, she was guilty; if she had led a good and proper life, this too was a proof, for witches dissemble and try to appear especially virtuous. After the woman was put in prison: if she was afraid, this proved her guilt; if she was not afraid, this proved her guilt, for witches characteristically pretend innocence and wear a bold front. Or on hearing of a denunciation of witchcraft against her, she might seek flight or remain; if she ran, that proved her guilt; if she remained, the devil had detained her so she could not get away.

Spee acted as confessor to many witches; he was thus in a position to observe every branch of the accusation tree, that no matter what the accused witch said or did, it was held as proof against her. In any individual case, you would only hear one branch of the dilemma. It is for this reason that scientists write down their experimental predictions in advance.

But you can’t have it both ways —as a matter of probability theory, not mere fairness. The rule that “absence of evidence is evidence of absence” is a special case of a more general law, which I would name Conservation of Expected Evidence: the expectation of the posterior probability, after viewing the evidence, must equal the prior probability.

> P(H) = P(H)
> P(H) = P(H,E) + P(H,~E)
> P(H) = P(H|E)*P(E) + P(H|~E)*P(~E)

Therefore, for every expectation of evidence, there is an equal and opposite expectation of counterevidence.

If you expect a strong probability of seeing weak evidence in one direction, it must be balanced by a weak expectation of seeing strong evidence in the other direction. If you’re very confident in your theory, and therefore anticipate seeing an outcome that matches your hypothesis, this can only provide a very small increment to your belief (it is already close to 1); but the unexpected failure of your prediction would (and must) deal your confidence a huge blow. On average, you must expect to be exactly as confident as when you started out. Equivalently, the mere expectation of encountering evidence—before you’ve actually seen it—should not shift your prior beliefs.

So if you claim that “no sabotage” is evidence for the existence of a Japanese-American Fifth Column, you must conversely hold that seeing sabotage would argue against a Fifth Column. If you claim that “a good and proper life” is evidence that a woman is a witch, then an evil and improper life must be evidence that she is not a witch. If you argue that God, to test humanity’s faith, refuses to reveal His existence, then the miracles described in the Bible must argue against the existence of God.

Doesn’t quite sound right, does it? Pay attention to that feeling of this seems a little forced, that quiet strain in the back of your mind. It’s important.

For a true Bayesian, it is impossible to seek evidence that confirms a theory. There is no possible plan you can devise, no clever strategy, no cunning device, by which you can legitimately expect your confidence in a fixed proposition to be higher (on average) than before. You can only ever seek evidence to test a theory, not to confirm it.

This realization can take quite a load off your mind. You need not worry about how to interpret every possible experimental result to confirm your theory. You needn’t bother planning how to make any given iota of evidence confirm your theory, because you know that for every expectation of evidence, there is an equal and oppositive expectation of counterevidence. If you try to weaken the counterevidence of a possible “abnormal” observation, you can only do it by weakening the support of a “normal” observation, to a precisely equal and opposite degree. It is a zero-sum game. No matter how you connive, no matter how you argue, no matter how you strategize, you can’t possibly expect the resulting game plan to shift your beliefs (on average) in a particular direction.

You might as well sit back and relax while you wait for the evidence to come in.

. . . Human psychology is so screwed up.
