## 爱因斯坦的傲慢

1919年，阿瑟·爱丁顿爵士率领考察队前往巴西和普林西比岛，旨在观测日食，从而检验爱因斯坦全新广义相对论的实验性预言。一位记者问爱因斯坦，如果爱丁顿的观测结果与他的理论不符，他会怎么办。爱因斯坦著名地回答：“那我只能为上帝感到遗憾，这个理论是对的。”

这听起来像是相当鲁莽的言论，违背了传统理性主义“实验至上”的信条。爱因斯坦似乎傲慢到不愿低头接受大自然的答案，而科学家本应如此。谁能在实验检验之前就知道理论是对的呢？

当然，事实证明爱因斯坦是对的。我尽量避免在别人正确时批评他们。如果他们真的值得批评，我很快就会等到他们犯错的机会。

而且，爱因斯坦可能并不像他说的那样鲁莽……

如果你想在一亿个可能的假说中，把正确答案的概率提升到50%以上，你至少需要27比特的证据（大致如此）。没有如此强有力的检验，你无法指望找到正确答案，因为较弱的检验会让不止一个候选通过所有测试。如果你用一个误报率为百万分之一（约20比特）的测试，最后还会剩下100个候选。仅仅是在庞大的可能性空间中找到正确答案，就需要大量证据。

传统理性主义强调“正当性”：“如果你想让我相信X，你必须给我Y量级的证据。”我自己也常常用这种说法，比如“要让某个命题的可信度超过99%，需要34比特的证据”，或者“要让你的假说概率超过50%，需要27比特的证据”。这种传统说法暗示你一开始有个直觉，或者某种私人推理得出了一个假说，然后你需要收集“证据”来证实它——说服科学界，或者证明你相信自己的直觉是合理的。

但从贝叶斯视角看，你仅仅是为了在理论空间中定位这个假说，就需要与其复杂度大致相当的证据量。这不是要向任何人证明什么。如果有一亿种可能性，你至少需要27比特的证据，才能把注意力唯一地集中在正确答案上。

即使你把自己的猜测称为“直觉”或“灵感”，这也同样成立。直觉和灵感是真实大脑中的真实过程。如果你的大脑没有至少10比特真正纠缠的有效贝叶斯证据可用，你的大脑就无法把一个正确的10比特假说单独挑出来——无论是有意识还是无意识。无意识过程不可能用19比特纠缠在一百万个目标中找到唯一正确答案，有意识过程也不行。直觉对直觉者来说可以是神秘的，但它们不能违反物理定律。

你应该明白了：在首次提出假说的那一刻——那些方程第一次浮现在他脑海时——爱因斯坦手头就已经有足够的观测证据，使他能把复杂的广义相对论方程独特地挑出来。否则他不可能得出正确答案。

那么，爱因斯坦恰好拥有足够的观测证据，让广义相对论进入他的关注视野，但只能让他赋予它55%的概率，这种可能性有多大？假设广义相对论是一个29.3比特的假说。爱因斯坦在阅读物理文献时，恰好偶然获得29.5比特证据的可能性有多大？

几乎没有！如果爱因斯坦一开始就有足够的观测证据把广义相对论的正确方程挑出来，那他很可能已经有足够的证据让自己极其确信广义相对论是真的。

事实上，由于人脑并不是信息处理的完美机器，爱因斯坦实际拥有的证据很可能远远超过了一个完美贝叶斯主义者所需的证据量，才能对广义相对论有极高的信心。

“那我只能为上帝感到遗憾，这个理论是对的。”——从这个角度看，这句话就没那么令人震惊了。别忘了，在那无数可能性中，广义相对论确实是对的。

## Einstein’s Arrogance

In 1919, Sir Arthur Eddington led expeditions to Brazil and to the island of Principe, aiming to observe solar eclipses and thereby test an experimental prediction of Einstein’s novel theory of General Relativity. A journalist asked Einstein what he would do if Eddington’s observations failed to match his theory. Einstein famously replied: “Then I would feel sorry for the good Lord. The theory is correct.”

It seems like a rather foolhardy statement, defying the trope of Traditional Rationality that experiment above all is sovereign. Einstein seems possessed of an arrogance so great that he would refuse to bend his neck and submit to Nature’s answer, as scientists must do. Who can know that the theory is correct, in advance of experimental test?

Of course, Einstein did turn out to be right. I try to avoid criticizing people when they are right. If they genuinely deserve criticism, I will not need to wait long for an occasion where they are wrong.

And Einstein may not have been quite so foolhardy as he sounded . . .

To assign more than 50% probability to the correct candidate from a pool of 100,000,000 possible hypotheses, you need at least 27 bits of evidence (or thereabouts). You cannot expect to find the correct candidate without tests that are this strong, because lesser tests will yield more than one candidate that passes all the tests. If you try to apply a test that only has a millionto-one chance of a false positive (∼20 bits), you’ll end up with a hundred candidates. Just finding the right answer, within a large space of possibilities, requires a large amount of evidence.

Traditional Rationality emphasizes justification: “If you want to convince me of X, you’ve got to present me with Y amount of evidence.” I myself often slip into this phrasing, whenever I say something like, “To justify believing in this proposition, at more than 99% probability, requires 34 bits of evidence.” Or, “In order to assign more than 50% probability to your hypothesis, you need 27 bits of evidence.” The Traditional phrasing implies that you start out with a hunch, or some private line of reasoning that leads you to a suggested hypothesis, and then you have to gather “evidence” to confirm it—to convince the scientific community, or justify saying that you believe in your hunch.

But from a Bayesian perspective, you need an amount of evidence roughly equivalent to the complexity of the hypothesis just to locate the hypothesis in theory-space. It’s not a question of justifying anything to anyone. If there’s a hundred million alternatives, you need at least 27 bits of evidence just to focus your attention uniquely on the correct answer.

This is true even if you call your guess a “hunch” or “intuition.” Hunchings and intuitings are real processes in a real brain. If your brain doesn’t have at least 10 bits of genuinely entangled valid Bayesian evidence to chew on, your brain cannot single out a correct 10-bit hypothesis for your attention—consciously, subconsciously, whatever. Subconscious processes can’t find one out of a million targets using only 19 bits of entanglement any more than conscious processes can. Hunches can be mysterious to the huncher, but they can’t violate the laws of physics.

You see where this is going: At the time of first formulating the hypothesis—the very first time the equations popped into his head—Einstein must have had, already in his possession, sufficient observational evidence to single out the complex equations of General Relativity for his unique attention. Or he couldn’t have gotten them right.

Now, how likely is it that Einstein would have exactly enough observational evidence to raise General Relativity to the level of his attention, but only justify assigning it a 55% probability? Suppose General Relativity is a 29.3-bit hypothesis. How likely is it that Einstein would stumble across exactly 29.5 bits of evidence in the course of his physics reading?

Not likely! If Einstein had enough observational evidence to single out the correct equations of General Relativity in the first place, then he probably had enough evidence to be damn sure that General Relativity was true.

In fact, since the human brain is not a perfectly efficient processor of information, Einstein probably had overwhelmingly more evidence than would, in principle, be required for a perfect Bayesian to assign massive confidence to General Relativity.

“Then I would feel sorry for the good Lord; the theory is correct.” It doesn’t sound nearly as appalling when you look at it from that perspective. And remember that General Relativity was correct, from all that vast space of possibilities.
