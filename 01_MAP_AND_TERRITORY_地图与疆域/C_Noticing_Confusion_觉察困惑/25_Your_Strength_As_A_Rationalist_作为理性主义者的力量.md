## 作为理性主义者的力量

以下是很久以前我在IRC聊天室里经历的一件事，那时我还经常泡在IRC上。时隔已久，记忆可能有些模糊，叙述也许不够精确。

事情是这样的：我在IRC聊天室时，有人说他的一个朋友需要医疗建议。他朋友说自己突然胸口疼，于是叫了救护车，救护车来了，但急救人员说没事就走了，现在胸痛反而更严重了。问大家该怎么办？

这个故事让我很困惑。我记得曾读过纽约的无家可归者会反复叫救护车，只是为了能被送到温暖的地方，而急救人员每次都必须把他们送到急诊室，哪怕已经是第27次。因为如果不送，救护公司可能会被告得倾家荡产。同样，急诊室有法律义务接收任何人，无论是否能付钱。<sup></sup>所以我不明白，故事里描述的情节怎么可能发生。任何报告突发胸痛的人都应该立刻被救护车带走才对。

而这正是我作为理性主义者失误的地方。我想起好几次，医生面对我觉得很严重的症状报告时，完全没有慌张。而医疗体系每次都是对的。每一次。我自己也曾胸口疼过，医生耐心地解释说那是胸肌疼，不是心脏病发作。于是我在IRC频道里说：“如果急救人员说你朋友没事，那肯定真没事——要是有哪怕一点严重的可能，他们早就把他带走了。”

就这样，我勉强用自己的现有模型解释了这个故事，虽然总觉得有点牵强……

后来，那个人又回到IRC聊天室，说他朋友其实是编的。显然，这不是他最靠谱的朋友之一。

也许我本该意识到，IRC频道里一个陌生人的朋友，未必比一篇发表的期刊文章更可靠。唉，相信总比怀疑容易；我们本能地相信，而怀疑则需要有意识的努力。<sup>2</sup>

所以，我拼命让自己的现实模型去解释一个根本没发生过的异常现象。我也知道这有多尴尬。我明白，一个模型的用处不在于它能解释什么，而在于它不能解释什么。一个什么都不排除、什么都允许的假说，无法约束你的预期。

你作为理性主义者的力量，在于你能对虚构比对现实更感到困惑。如果你能同样轻松地解释任何结果，那你就一无所知。

我们都会有软弱的时候；可悲的是，我本可以做得更好。我拥有得出正确答案所需的全部信息，甚至已经注意到了问题，但我却忽略了它。那种困惑的感觉其实是一个线索，而我把这个线索丢掉了。

我本该更关注那种“还是觉得有点牵强”的感觉。这是一个追求真理者最重要的感受之一，也是你作为理性主义者的力量的一部分。人类认知的一个设计缺陷，就是这种感觉只是在你脑海深处隐隐作痛，而不是像警报器一样大声鸣响，或者像霓虹灯一样闪烁着：

    要么你的模型是错的，要么这个故事是假的。

<sup>1</sup>而医院要承担巨额费用，所以很多医院关闭了急诊室……这让人不禁怀疑，如果我们根本不理会经济学家，为什么还要有经济学家。

## Your Strength as a Rationalist

The following happened to me in an IRC chatroom, long enough ago that I was still hanging around in IRC chatrooms. Time has fuzzed the memory and my report may be imprecise.

So there I was, in an IRC chatroom, when someone reports that a friend of his needs medical advice. His friend says that he’s been having sudden chest pains, so he called an ambulance, and the ambulance showed up, but the paramedics told him it was nothing, and left, and now the chest pains are getting worse. What should his friend do?

I was confused by this story. I remembered reading about homeless people in New York who would call ambulances just to be taken someplace warm, and how the paramedics always had to take them to the emergency room, even on the 27th iteration. Because if they didn’t, the ambulance company could be sued for lots and lots of money. Likewise, emergency rooms are legally obligated to treat anyone, regardless of ability to pay.<sup></sup> So I didn’t quite understand how the described events could have happened. Anyone reporting sudden chest pains should have been hauled off by an ambulance instantly.

And this is where I fell down as a rationalist. I remembered several oc- casions where my doctor would completely fail to panic at the report of symptoms that seemed, to me, very alarming. And the Medical Establish- ment was always right. Every single time. I had chest pains myself, at one point, and the doctor patiently explained to me that I was describing chest muscle pain, not a heart attack. So I said into the IRC channel, “Well, if the paramedics told your friend it was nothing, it must really be nothing—they’d have hauled him off if there was the tiniest chance of serious trouble.”

Thus I managed to explain the story within my existing model, though the fit still felt a little forced . . .

Later on, the fellow comes back into the IRC chatroom and says his friend made the whole thing up. Evidently this was not one of his more reliable friends.

I should have realized, perhaps, that an unknown acquaintance of an acquaintance in an IRC channel might be less reliable than a published journal article. Alas, belief is easier than disbelief; we believe instinctively, but disbelief requires a conscious effort.<sup>2</sup>

So instead, by dint of mighty straining, I forced my model of reality to explain an anomaly that never actually happened. And I knew how em- barrassing this was. I knew that the usefulness of a model is not what it can explain, but what it can’t. A hypothesis that forbids nothing, permits everything, and thereby fails to constrain anticipation.

Your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more confused by fiction than by reality. If you are equally good at explaining any outcome, you have zero knowledge.

We are all weak, from time to time; the sad part is that I could have been stronger. I had all the information I needed to arrive at the correct answer, I even noticed the problem, and then I ignored it. My feeling of confusion was a Clue, and I threw my Clue away.

I should have paid more attention to that sensation of still feels a little forced. It’s one of the most important feelings a truthseeker can have, a part of your strength as a rationalist. It is a design flaw in human cognition that this sensation manifests as a quiet strain in the back of your mind, instead of a wailing alarm siren and a glowing neon sign reading:
	
	EITHER YOUR MODEL IS FALSE OR THIS STORY IS WRONG.

<sup>1</sup>And the hospital absorbs the costs, which are enormous, so hospitals are closing their emergency rooms . . . It makes you wonder what’s the point of having economists if we’re just going to ignore them.

<sup>2</sup>From McCluskey (2007), “Truth Bias”: “[P]eople are more likely to correctly judge that a truthful statement is true than that a lie is false. This appears to be a fairly robust result that is not just a function of truth being the correct guess where the evidence is weak—it shows up in controlled experiments where subjects have good reason not to assume truth[.]” http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/08/truth-bias.html. And from Gilbert et al. (993), “You Can’t Not Believe Everything You Read”: “Can people comprehend assertions without believing them? [...] Three experiments support the hypothesis that comprehension includes an initial belief in the information comprehended.”
