## 透明错觉：为什么没人懂你

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

在“事后诸葛”偏差中，知道某个情境结果的人会认为，这个结果本该很容易被提前预测。知道了结果后，我们会用这个结果重新解释整个情境。即使事先被提醒，我们也无法“去解释”，无法真正体会那些不知道答案的人的感受。

与此密切相关的是“透明错觉”：我们总是清楚自己话语的含义，因此也期望别人能明白。当我们阅读自己的文字时，凭借对自己真实意图的了解，正确的解释自然而然地浮现出来。很难设身处地体会，别人只能凭字面意思去盲目揣测。

June 向 Mark 推荐了一家餐厅；Mark 去吃饭后发现（a）食物一般、服务平平，或（b）食物美味、服务无可挑剔。然后 Mark 在 June 的电话答录机上留言：“June，我刚在你推荐的餐厅吃完饭，我得说，太棒了，真的太棒了。”Keysar（1994）让一组被试看到情景（a），59% 的人认为 Mark 的留言是讽刺的，并且 Jane 也会察觉到讽刺。<sup>1</sup> 另一组被试看到情景（b），只有 3% 认为 Jane 会觉得 Mark 的留言是讽刺的。Keysar 和 Barr（2002）似乎还让被试听了真实的语音留言。<sup>2</sup> Keysar（1998）还发现，如果被试被告知餐厅很糟糕，但 Mark 想掩饰自己的真实感受，他们认为 June 不会在（同样的）留言中察觉到讽刺：<sup>3</sup>

> 无论 Mark 是想掩饰负面体验，还是确实很满意，被试都同样认为 June 会察觉到讽刺。也就是说，被试把 Mark 的交流意图视为透明的。仿佛他们默认 June 会感受到 Mark 想让她感受到的任何意图。<sup>4</sup>

“The goose hangs high”（鹅挂得高）是一个已经过时的英语习语。Keysar 和 Bly（1995）告诉一组被试，这句话的意思是“未来看起来很好”；告诉另一组被试，这句话的意思是“未来看起来很糟”。<sup>5</sup> 然后让被试判断，一个不知情的听众更可能把这个习语理解成哪种意思。每组都认为听众会理解成他们被告知的“标准”意思。<sup>6</sup>

Keysar 和 Henly（2002）测试了说话者的“校准”能力：说话者会低估、高估还是准确估计听众理解自己的频率？<sup>7</sup> 说话者拿到一些有歧义的句子（如“The man is chasing a woman on a bicycle.”），以及消除歧义的图片（一名男子追着骑自行车的女人跑）。说话者要在听众面前说出这些句子，并估计有多少听众能理解自己的本意。说话者认为自己被理解的概率是 72%，实际上只有 61%。当听众没理解时，说话者有 46% 的概率以为对方理解了；当听众理解时，说话者只有 12% 的概率以为对方没理解。

旁听者（不是说话者本人）则没有这种偏差，认为听众理解的概率只有 56%。

正如 Keysar 和 Barr 指出，德国进攻波兰前两天，张伯伦曾发信，意在明确表示英国若德国入侵就会参战。但这封用外交辞令写成的信，被希特勒听成了“和解”，于是坦克开动了。

不要太快责怪那些没听懂你“明明很清楚”的话，无论是口头还是书面。很可能，你的话比你想象的更模糊。

## Illusion of Transparency: Why No One Understands You

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

In hindsight bias, people who know the outcome of a situation believe the outcome should have been easy to predict in advance. Knowing the outcome, we reinterpret the situation in light of that outcome. Even when warned, we can’t de-interpret to empathize with someone who doesn’t know what we know.

Closely related is the illusion of transparency: We always know what we mean by our words, and so we expect others to know it too. Reading our own writing, the intended interpretation falls easily into place, guided by our knowledge of what we really meant. It’s hard to empathize with someone who must interpret blindly, guided only by the words.

June recommends a restaurant to Mark; Mark dines there and discovers (a) unimpressive food and mediocre service or (b) delicious food and impeccable service. Then Mark leaves the following message on June’s answering machine: “June, I just finished dinner at the restaurant you recommended, and I must say, it was marvelous, just marvelous.” Keysar (1994) presented a group of subjects with scenario (a), and 59% thought that Mark’s message was sarcastic and that Jane would perceive the sarcasm.<sup>1</sup> Among other subjects, told scenario (b), only 3% thought that Jane would perceive Mark’s message as sarcastic. Keysar and Barr (2002) seem to indicate that an actual voice message was played back to the subjects.<sup>2</sup> Keysar (1998) showed that if subjects were told that the restaurant was horrible but that Mark wanted to conceal his response, they believed June would not perceive sarcasm in the (same) message:<sup>3</sup>

> They were just as likely to predict that she would perceive sarcasm when he attempted to conceal his negative experience as when he had a positive experience and was truly sincere. So participants took Mark’s communicative intention as transparent. It was as if they assumed that June would perceive whatever intention Mark wanted her to perceive.<sup>4</sup>

“The goose hangs high” is an archaic English idiom that has passed out of use in modern language. Keysar and Bly (1995) told one group of subjects that “the goose hangs high” meant that the future looks good; another group of subjects learned that “the goose hangs high” meant the future looks gloomy.<sup>5</sup> Subjects were then asked which of these two meanings an uninformed listener would be more likely to attribute to the idiom. Each group thought that listeners would perceive the meaning presented as “standard.”<sup>6</sup>

Keysar and Henly (2002) tested the calibration of speakers: Would speakers underestimate, overestimate, or correctly estimate how often listeners understood them?<sup>7</sup> Speakers were given ambiguous sentences (“The man is chasing a woman on a bicycle.”) and disambiguating pictures (a man running after a cycling woman). Speakers were then asked to utter the words in front of addressees, and asked to estimate how many addressees understood the intended meaning. Speakers thought that they were understood in 72% of cases and were actually understood in 61% of cases. When addressees did not understand, speakers thought they did in 46% of cases; when addressees did understand, speakers thought they did not in only 12% of cases.

Additional subjects who overheard the explanation showed no such bias, expecting listeners to understand in only 56% of cases.

As Keysar and Barr note, two days before Germany’s attack on Poland, Chamberlain sent a letter intended to make it clear that Britain would fight if any invasion occurred. The letter, phrased in polite diplomatese, was heard by Hitler as conciliatory—and the tanks rolled.

Be not too quick to blame those who misunderstand your perfectly clear sentences, spoken or written. Chances are, your words are more ambiguous than you think.
