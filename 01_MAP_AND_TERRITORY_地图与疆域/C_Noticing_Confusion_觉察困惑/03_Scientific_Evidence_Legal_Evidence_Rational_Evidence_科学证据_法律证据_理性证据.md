## 科学证据、法律证据、理性证据

作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky

假设你的好朋友、警察局长，私下里郑重告诉你，你们城市的犯罪头目是 Wulky Wilkinsen。作为一个理性主义者，你有理由相信这个说法吗？换句话说：如果你接下来去当面侮辱 Wulky，我会说你太鲁莽了。既然理智的做法是把 Wulky 视为比默认概率高得多的犯罪头目，那么警察局长的说法一定是强有力的贝叶斯证据。

我们的法律体系不会仅凭警察局长的一句话就把 Wulky 关进监狱。这种说法不能作为法律证据。如果你把所有被警察局长指认为犯罪头目的人都关起来，一开始你可能会抓到不少真正的犯罪头目，只有少数是局长不喜欢的人。但不受约束的权力就像蜜吸引苍蝇一样吸引腐败：随着时间推移，你会抓到越来越少的真正犯罪头目（他们会更努力地隐藏身份），而无辜受害者却越来越多。

但这并不意味着警察局长的说法不是理性证据。它依然有极不对称的似然比，你依然会因为侮辱 Wulky 而显得愚蠢。但在社会层面，为了社会目标，我们有意将“法律证据”限定为某些特定类型的证据，比如警察局长在 4 月 4 日夜晚亲眼所见。理想情况下，所有法律证据都应该是理性证据，但反过来却不成立。我们在将理性证据认定为“法律证据”之前，会施加特殊、严格、额外的标准。

当我在 2007 年 8 月 18 日太平洋时间晚上 8:33 写下这句话时，我穿着白袜子。作为理性主义者，你有理由相信我刚才的陈述吗？有。那我能在法庭上为此作证吗？可以。这是科学陈述吗？不是，因为你无法亲自做实验来验证。科学由适用于许多具体实例的普遍化组成，这样你可以通过新的现实实验来检验这些普遍化，从而自己验证它们的真实性，无需相信任何权威。科学是人类可公开复现的知识。

和法庭系统一样，科学作为一种社会过程，是由会犯错的人类组成的。我们希望有一套特别可靠的信念池，也希望有社会规则鼓励这类知识的产生。因此，在将理性知识“封圣”为“科学知识”、纳入受保护信念池之前，我们会施加特殊、严格、额外的标准。理性主义者有理由相信亚历山大大帝确实存在过吗？有。我们对古希腊有一个大致的了解，虽然不完全可靠，但总比一无所知强。但我们依赖于像普鲁塔克这样的权威，无法自己验证一切。历史知识不是科学知识。

理性主义者有理由相信太阳会在 2007 年 9 月 18 日升起吗？有——虽然不是绝对确定，但理性下注就是如此。<sup>1</sup> 那么，当我在 2007 年 8 月 18 日写下这篇文章时，这算是科学信念吗？

把“太阳会在 2007 年 9 月 18 日升起”这样的说法不称为“科学的”，似乎有点怪。如果科学不能预测尚未发生的未来事件，那它就毫无用处——无法在实验前做出任何预测。太阳会升起的预测，确实是基于科学普遍化的推断。它基于你可以自己通过实验检验的太阳系模型。

但想象你正在设计一个实验，想在新情境下验证被接受理论 Q 的第 27 个预测。你也许没有具体理由怀疑这个信念是错的，只是想在新情境下测试一下。在实验前就说对结果有“科学信念”，似乎很危险。你可以说有“常规预测”或“理论 Q 的预测”。但如果你已经知道结果的“科学信念”，那还做什么实验呢？

希望你能明白，为什么我把科学等同于普遍化，而不是某个实验的历史。历史事件只发生一次，普遍化适用于许多事件。历史不可复现，科学普遍化可以复现。

我的“科学知识”定义真实吗？这不是一个良好定义的问题。我们对科学施加的特殊标准，是出于实用考虑。没有哪颗星星或哪座山上写着“p < 0.05 必须是科学发表的标准”。现在很多人认为 0.05 太宽松，建议降到 0.01 或 0.001。

也许未来的人们会认为，科学就是人类公开、可复现的知识，只有发表在开放获取期刊上的论文才算“科学”。如果你要收费才能获取知识，那它还算人类的知识吗？如果必须付费才能批评某个结果，我们还能完全信任它吗？

就我个人而言，我认为只有开放、公开的知识才应被计入科学实践。但无论我们如何定义“科学”，年费两万美元的闭门期刊里的信息依然是贝叶斯证据；警察局长私下保证 Wulky 是头目，也同样如此。

## Scientific Evidence, Legal Evidence, Rational Evidence

by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Suppose that your good friend, the police commissioner, tells you in strictest confidence that the crime kingpin of your city is Wulky Wilkinsen. As a rationalist, are you licensed to believe this statement? Put it this way: if you go ahead and insult Wulky, I’d call you foolhardy. Since it is prudent to act as if Wulky has a substantially higher-than-default probability of being a crime boss, the police commissioner’s statement must have been strong Bayesian evidence.

Our legal system will not imprison Wulky on the basis of the police commissioner’s statement. It is not admissible as legal evidence. Maybe if you locked up every person accused of being a crime boss by a police commissioner, you’d initially catch a lot of crime bosses, and relatively few people the commissioner just didn’t like. But unrestrained power attracts corruption like honey attracts flies: over time, you’d catch fewer and fewer real crime bosses (who would go to greater lengths to ensure anonymity), and more and more innocent victims.

This does not mean that the police commissioner’s statement is not rational evidence. It still has a lopsided likelihood ratio, and you’d still be a fool to insult Wulky. But on a social level, in pursuit of a social goal, we deliberately define “legal evidence” to include only particular kinds of evidence, such as the police commissioner’s own observations on the night of April 4th. All legal evidence should ideally be rational evidence, but not the other way around. We impose special, strong, additional standards before we anoint rational evidence as “legal evidence.”

As I write this sentence at 8:33 p.m., Pacific time, on August 18th, 2007, I am wearing white socks. As a rationalist, are you licensed to believe the previous statement? Yes. Could I testify to it in court? Yes. Is it a scientific statement? No, because there is no experiment you can perform yourself to verify it. Science is made up of generalizations which apply to many particular instances, so that you can run new real-world experiments which test the generalization, and thereby verify for yourself that the generalization is true, without having to trust anyone’s authority. Science is the publicly reproducible knowledge of humankind.

Like a court system, science as a social process is made up of fallible humans. We want a protected pool of beliefs that are especially reliable. And we want social rules that encourage the generation of such knowledge. So we impose special, strong, additional standards before we canonize rational knowledge as “scientific knowledge,” adding it to the protected belief pool. Is a rationalist licensed to believe in the historical existence of Alexander the Great? Yes. We have a rough picture of ancient Greece, untrustworthy but better than maximum entropy. But we are dependent on authorities such as Plutarch; we cannot discard Plutarch and verify everything for ourselves. Historical knowledge is not scientific knowledge.

Is a rationalist licensed to believe that the Sun will rise on September 18th, 2007? Yes—not with absolute certainty, but that’s the way to bet.<sup>1</sup>Is this statement, as I write this essay on August 18th, 2007, a scientific belief?

It may seem perverse to deny the adjective “scientific” to statements like “The Sun will rise on September 18th, 2007.” If Science could not make predictions about future events—events which have not yet happened—then it would be useless; it could make no prediction in advance of experiment. The prediction that the Sun will rise is, definitely, an extrapolation from scientific generalizations. It is based upon models of the Solar System that you could test for yourself by experiment.

But imagine that you’re constructing an experiment to verify prediction #27, in a new context, of an accepted theory Q. You may not have any concrete reason to suspect the belief is wrong; you just want to test it in a new context. It seems dangerous to say, before running the experiment, that there is a “scientific belief” about the result. There is a “conventional prediction” or “theory Q’s prediction.” But if you already know the “scientific belief” about the result, why bother to run the experiment?

You begin to see, I hope, why I identify Science with generalizations, rather than the history of any one experiment. A historical event happens once; generalizations apply over many events. History is not reproducible; scientific generalizations are.

Is my definition of “scientific knowledge” true? That is not a well-formed question. The special standards we impose upon science are pragmatic choices. Nowhere upon the stars or the mountains is it written that p < 0.05 shall be the standard for scientific publication. Many now argue that 0.05 is too weak, and that it would be useful to lower it to 0.01 or 0.001.

Perhaps future generations, acting on the theory that science is the public, reproducible knowledge of humankind, will only label as “scientific” papers published in an open-access journal. If you charge for access to the knowledge, is it part of the knowledge of humankind? Can we fully trust a result if people must pay to criticize it?

For myself, I think scientific practice would be better served by the dictum that only open, public knowledge counts. But however we choose to define “science,” information in a $20,000/year closed-access journal will still count as Bayesian evidence; and so too, the police commissioner’s private assurance that Wulky is the kingpin.
