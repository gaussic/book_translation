你走在街上，鞋带松了。不久之后，出于某种奇怪的原因，你开始相信自己的鞋带松了。阳光照射到你的鞋带上并反射回来；一些光子进入你的瞳孔，击中你的视网膜；光子的能量触发神经冲动；神经冲动被传递到大脑的视觉处理区域；在那里，光学信息被处理并重建为一个三维模型，被识别为松开的鞋带。在世界和你的大脑中，有一连串的事件、因果链条，最终让你相信了你所相信的东西。这个过程的最终结果，是你的心智状态反映了你鞋带的真实状态。

什么是证据？证据是通过因果链条与你想了解的事物纠缠在一起的事件。例如，如果你的关注对象是鞋带，那么进入你瞳孔的光就是与你的鞋带纠缠的证据。这里的“纠缠”不要和物理学中的技术术语混淆——我这里只是指两件事物因为因果链条而最终处于相关状态。

并不是所有影响都能产生证据所需的那种“纠缠”。如果你有一台机器，无论你输入的是中奖彩票号码还是废票号码，它都会响，那么这台机器就没什么用。如果无论你的鞋带是系着还是松着，反射出来的光子最终都处于同样的物理状态，那么这些光也就无法作为鞋带的证据。

抽象地说：一个事件要成为某个目标问题的证据，它必须以某种与目标不同可能状态相关联的方式发生。（技术上说：证据事件与目标之间，关于你当前对两者的不确定状态，必须存在香农互信息。）

纠缠在被正确处理时是可以传染的，这也是你需要眼睛和大脑的原因。如果光子从你的鞋带反射后击中一块石头，石头几乎不会发生变化。石头不会以有用的方式反映鞋带的状态；无论鞋带是否系好，石头都不会有可检测的不同。这就是为什么石头在法庭上不是有用的证人。一张胶片会从入射光子那里获得鞋带的“纠缠”，这样照片本身就能作为证据。如果你的眼睛和大脑工作正常，你就会和自己的鞋带“纠缠”在一起。

这也是为什么理性主义者如此重视那句看似悖论的话：只有在原则上你可以被说服相信相反时，一个信念才真正有价值。如果你的视网膜无论进入什么光都处于同样的状态，你就会失明。有些信仰体系，为了自我强化，会说只有无条件相信某些信念才有价值——无论你看到什么、想到什么，你的大脑都应该保持同样的状态。这就是“盲信”一词的由来。如果你的信念不依赖于你所见，你就和被戳瞎眼睛一样失明了。

如果你的眼睛和大脑工作正常，你的信念最终会与事实纠缠。理性思考会产生本身就是证据的信念。

如果你说话诚实，你的理性信念（本身就是证据）也可以成为他人的证据。纠缠可以通过因果链条传播——如果你说话，别人听见，这也是因果关系。当你用手机说“我的鞋带松了”，你就是在和朋友分享你与鞋带的纠缠。

因此，在彼此信任的诚实人之间，理性信念是可以“传染”的。这也是为什么如果有人声称自己的信念不可传递——即你相信的理由是私人的、无法传达的——会让人觉得可疑。如果你的信念与现实纠缠，它们就应该能在诚实人之间传播。

如果你的现实模型暗示你的思维产出不应该对他人有传染性，那么你的模型其实是在说你的信念本身不是证据，也就是说它们没有和现实纠缠。你应该反思并停止相信。

事实上，如果你能在直觉层面体会到这一切的含义，你会自然而然地停止相信。因为“我的信念与现实无关”就意味着“我的信念不准确”。一旦你不再相信“‘雪是白的’为真”，你也应该（自然而然地！）不再相信“雪是白的”，否则就有问题了。

所以，试着解释一下你所用的思维过程为什么能系统性地产生反映现实的信念。解释一下你为什么认为自己是理性的。为什么你认为，像你这样思考的人，只有在雪是白的时候才会相信“雪是白的”。如果你不相信你的思维产出和现实纠缠，为什么还要相信你的思维产出？这其实是同一回事，或者说本该如此。

## What Is Evidence?

Walking along the street, your shoelaces come untied. Shortly thereafter, for some odd reason, you start believing your shoelaces are untied. Light leaves the Sun and strikes your shoelaces and bounces off; some photons enter the pupils of your eyes and strike your retina; the energy of the photons triggers neural impulses; the neural impulses are transmitted to the visual-processing areas of the brain; and there the optical information is processed and reconstructed into a 3D model that is recognized as an untied shoelace. There is a sequence of events, a chain of cause and effect, within the world and your brain, by which you end up believing what you believe. The final outcome of the process is a state of mind which mirrors the state of your actual shoelaces.

What is evidence? It is an event entangled, by links of cause and effect, with whatever you want to know about. If the target of your inquiry is your shoelaces, for example, then the light entering your pupils is evidence entangled with your shoelaces. This should not be confused with the technical sense of “entanglement” used in physics—here I’m just talking about “entanglement” in the sense of two things that end up in correlated states because of the links of cause and effect between them.

Not every influence creates the kind of “entanglement” required for evidence. It’s no help to have a machine that beeps when you enter winning lottery numbers, if the machine also beeps when you enter losing lottery numbers. The light reflected from your shoes would not be useful evidence about your shoelaces, if the photons ended up in the same physical state whether your shoelaces were tied or untied.

To say it abstractly: For an event to be evidence about a target of inquiry, it has to happen differently in a way that’s entangled with the different possible states of the target. (To say it technically: There has to be Shannon mutual information between the evidential event and the target of inquiry, relative to your current state of uncertainty about both of them.)

Entanglement can be contagious when processed correctly, which is why you need eyes and a brain. If photons reflect off your shoelaces and hit a rock, the rock won’t change much. The rock won’t reflect the shoelaces in any helpful way; it won’t be detectably different depending on whether your shoelaces were tied or untied. This is why rocks are not useful witnesses in court. A photographic film will contract shoelace-entanglement from the incoming photons, so that the photo can itself act as evidence. If your eyes and brain work correctly, you will become tangled up with your own shoelaces.

This is why rationalists put such a heavy premium on the paradoxical-seeming claim that a belief is only really worthwhile if you could, in principle, be persuaded to believe otherwise. If your retina ended up in the same state regardless of what light entered it, you would be blind. Some belief systems, in a rather obvious trick to reinforce themselves, say that certain beliefs are only really worthwhile if you believe them unconditionally—no matter what you see, no matter what you think. Your brain is supposed to end up in the same state regardless. Hence the phrase, “blind faith.” If what you believe doesn’t depend on what you see, you’ve been blinded as effectively as by poking out your eyeballs.

If your eyes and brain work correctly, your beliefs will end up entangled with the facts. Rational thought produces beliefs which are themselves evidence.

If your tongue speaks truly, your rational beliefs, which are themselves evidence, can act as evidence for someone else. Entanglement can be transmitted through chains of cause and effect—and if you speak, and another hears, that too is cause and effect. When you say “My shoelaces are untied” over a cellphone, you’re sharing your entanglement with your shoelaces with a friend.

Therefore rational beliefs are contagious, among honest folk who believe each other to be honest. And it’s why a claim that your beliefs are not contagious—that you believe for private reasons which are not transmissible—is so suspicious. If your beliefs are entangled with reality, they should be contagious among honest folk.

If your model of reality suggests that the outputs of your thought processes should not be contagious to others, then your model says that your beliefs are not themselves evidence, meaning they are not entangled with reality. You should apply a reflective correction, and stop believing.

Indeed, if you feel, on a gut level, what this all means, you will automatically stop believing. Because “my belief is not entangled with reality” means “my belief is not accurate.” As soon as you stop believing “ ‘snow is white’ is true,” you should (automatically!) stop believing “snow is white,” or something is very wrong.

So try to explain why the kind of thought processes you use systematically produce beliefs that mirror reality. Explain why you think you’re rational. Why you think that, using thought processes like the ones you use, minds will end up believing “snow is white” if and only if snow is white. If you don’t believe that the outputs of your thought processes are entangled with reality, why believe the outputs of your thought processes? It’s the same thing, or it should be.
