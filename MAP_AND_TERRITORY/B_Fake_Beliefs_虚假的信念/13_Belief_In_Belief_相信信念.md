## 信仰信仰

## 相信信念

卡尔·萨根曾讲过这样一个寓言：有人走过来对我们说：“我的车库里有一条龙。”多么有趣！我们回答说我们想去看看这条龙——让我们立刻去车库吧！“等等，”那人对我们说，“这是一条隐形的龙。”

正如萨根指出的，这并不意味着这个假设无法证伪。也许我们去了那人的车库，虽然没看到龙，但听到了某种看不见来源的沉重呼吸声；地上神秘地出现了脚印；仪器显示车库里有什么东西在消耗氧气并呼出二氧化碳。

但假设我们对那人说：“好吧，我们去车库听听有没有沉重的呼吸声。”那人立刻说，不行，这是一条听不见的龙。我们提议测量空气中的二氧化碳，那人又说这条龙不呼吸。我们提议往空中撒一袋面粉，看能不能勾勒出隐形龙的轮廓，那人马上说：“这条龙对面粉是可渗透的。”

卡尔·萨根用这个寓言来说明一个经典道理：糟糕的假说总是要不断变换花样来逃避证伪。但我讲这个寓言，是想说明另一点：这个声称有龙的人，脑海里某处一定有一个准确的情境模型，因为他能提前预见到需要为哪些实验结果找借口。

有些哲学家对这种情形感到困惑，问道：“这个人真的相信有龙存在吗？”仿佛人脑一次只能存储一个信念！真实的头脑远比这复杂。信念有不同类型；并非所有信念都是直接的预期。很明显，这个人并不期待打开车库门时会看到什么异常，否则他不会提前找好借口。也许他的命题信念池里有一句漂浮的话：“我的车库里有一条龙。”在理性主义者看来，这两种信念即使类型不同，也应该发生冲突。但事实上，你完全可以在一张蓝天的照片旁写上“天空是绿色的！”而纸张并不会自燃。

理性主义者所推崇的经验主义美德，正是为了防止我们犯下这类错误。我们应该不断追问自己的信念会预言哪些体验，让它们在预期上“付房租”。但声称有龙的人的问题更深，不是简单的建议就能解决的。其实，把“相信有龙”与“预期在车库中体验到什么”联系起来并不难。如果你相信车库里有龙，那你就会期待打开门时看到一条龙。如果你没看到龙，那就说明车库里没有龙。这很直接。你甚至可以在自己家车库试试。

不，这种“隐形”只是更严重问题的一个症状。

根据你的童年经历，你也许记得有一段时间，你开始怀疑圣诞老人是否存在，但你仍然相信自己应该相信圣诞老人，于是你努力否认自己的怀疑。正如丹尼尔·丹尼特所说，当一件事很难相信时，往往更容易相信“你应该相信它”。相信“终极宇宙天空既是完美的蓝色又是完美的绿色”是什么意思？这个说法本身就让人困惑——甚至都不清楚“相信它”到底意味着什么。如果你真的相信，会相信什么？你更容易相信“相信终极宇宙天空既是完美的蓝色又是完美的绿色”是合适的、善良的、有美德的、有益的。丹尼特把这称为“相信信念”。<sup>1</sup>

而事情变得复杂起来，正如人类头脑常常那样——我认为即使是丹尼特也把这种心理机制简化了。首先，如果你相信信念，你不会承认自己只是相信信念。美德在于“相信”，而不是“相信自己相信”；所以如果你只是相信信念而不是直接相信，你就不算有美德。没人会对自己说：“我不相信终极宇宙天空是蓝色和绿色的，但我相信我应该相信它”——除非他极其善于承认自己的不够美德。人们不会相信“相信信念”，他们只是相信信念。

（如果你觉得这很困惑，学习一下数理逻辑可能会有帮助，逻辑训练你区分命题P、P的证明、以及“P可证”的证明。同样也要区分P、想要P、相信P、想要相信P，以及相信自己相信P。）

相信信念有不同的类型。你可以明确地相信信念；你可以在有意识的思维流中默念“相信终极宇宙天空既是完美的蓝色又是完美的绿色是有美德的”。（同时还相信自己相信这一点，除非你极其善于承认自己的不够美德。）但也有更隐晦的相信信念形式。也许声称有龙的人害怕如果公开承认自己错了会被嘲笑。<sup>2</sup> 也许他害怕承认自己其实没有龙，因为这与他“我是发现龙的伟大探索者”的自我形象冲突——他看到了别人都没看到的东西。

如果我们所有的思想都是像哲学家那样操作的有意识语言句子，人类头脑就容易理解多了。转瞬即逝的心象、未说出口的回避、未经承认的欲望——这些和语言一样，都是我们自我的重要组成部分。

虽然我在一些细节和复杂性上不同意丹尼特，但我仍然认为“相信信念”这个概念是理解“声称有龙者”的关键洞见。但我们需要一个更广义的信念概念，不仅限于语言句子。“信念”应包括未说出口的预期控制器，“相信信念”应包括未说出口的认知-行为引导器。说“声称有龙的人并不相信车库里有龙，只是相信相信有龙是有益的”在心理学上并不现实。但说“他在预期上表现得好像车库里没有龙，在找借口时表现得好像他相信信念”则是现实的。

你完全可以脑海里有一幅没有龙的车库的普通画面，正确地预期打开门时的体验，却从未在脑中出现“我的车库里没有龙”这样的语言句子。我敢打赌你也有过——当你打开车库门或卧室门时，预期不会看到龙，脑中并不会浮现“没有龙”这样的句子。

而要回避放弃你对龙的信念——或者回避放弃“我是相信有龙的人”这个自我形象——你并不需要明确地想“我想相信我的车库里有龙”。你只需要回避承认自己其实并不相信。

如果有人既相信信念龙，也真的相信有龙，问题就没那么严重。他们愿意在实验预测上冒险，甚至可能同意如果实验预测错了就放弃信念。<sup>3</sup> 但如果有人提前找好借口，那就说明信念和相信信念已经不同步了。

<sup>2</sup> 事实上，理性主义者会为他们感到高兴，而如果他们继续声称车库里有龙，反而更容易被人嘲笑。

<sup>3</sup> 当然，如果信念本身并非绝对坚定，相信信念依然可能干扰放弃信念的过程。

## Belief in Belief

Carl Sagan once told a parable of someone who comes to us and claims: “There is a dragon in my garage.” Fascinating! We reply that we wish to see this dragon—let us set out at once for the garage! “But wait,” the claimant says to us, “it is an invisible dragon.”

Now as Sagan points out, this doesn’t make the hypothesis unfalsifiable. Perhaps we go to the claimant’s garage, and although we see no dragon, we hear heavy breathing from no visible source; footprints mysteriously appear on the ground; and instruments show that something in the garage is consuming oxygen and breathing out carbon dioxide.

But now suppose that we say to the claimant, “Okay, we’ll visit the garage and see if we can hear heavy breathing,” and the claimant quickly says no, it’s an inaudible dragon. We propose to measure carbon dioxide in the air, and the claimant says the dragon does not breathe. We propose to toss a bag of flour into the air to see if it outlines an invisible dragon, and the claimant immediately says, “The dragon is permeable to flour.”

Carl Sagan used this parable to illustrate the classic moral that poor hypotheses need to do fast footwork to avoid falsification. But I tell this parable to make a different point: The claimant must have an accurate model of the situation somewhere in their mind, because they can anticipate, in advance, exactly which experimental results they’ll need to excuse.

Some philosophers have been much confused by such scenarios, asking, “Does the claimant really believe there’s a dragon present, or not?” As if the human brain only had enough disk space to represent one belief at a time! Real minds are more tangled than that. There are different types of belief; not all beliefs are direct anticipations. The claimant clearly does not anticipate seeing anything unusual upon opening the garage door. Otherwise they wouldn’t make advance excuses. It may also be that the claimant’s pool of propositional beliefs contains the free-floating statement There is a dragon in my garage. It may seem, to a rationalist, that these two beliefs should collide and conflict even though they are of different types. Yet it is a physical fact that you can write “The sky is green!” next to a picture of a blue sky without the paper bursting into flames.

The rationalist virtue of empiricism is supposed to prevent us from making this class of mistake. We’re supposed to constantly ask our beliefs which experiences they predict, make them pay rent in anticipation. But the dragon-claimant’s problem runs deeper, and cannot be cured with such simple advice. It’s not exactly difficult to connect belief in a dragon to anticipated experience of the garage. If you believe there’s a dragon in your garage, then you can expect to open up the door and see a dragon. If you don’t see a dragon, then that means there’s no dragon in your garage. This is pretty straightforward. You can even try it with your own garage.

No, this invisibility business is a symptom of something much worse.

Depending on how your childhood went, you may remember a time period when you first began to doubt Santa Claus’s existence, but you still believed that you were supposed to believe in Santa Claus, so you tried to deny the doubts. As Daniel Dennett observes, where it is difficult to believe a thing, it is often much easier to believe that you ought to believe it. What does it mean to believe that the Ultimate Cosmic Sky is both perfectly blue and perfectly green? The statement is confusing; it’s not even clear what it would mean to believe it—what exactly would be believed, if you believed. You can much more easily believe that it is proper, that it is good and virtuous and beneficial, to believe that the Ultimate Cosmic Sky is both perfectly blue and perfectly green. Dennett calls this “belief in belief.”<sup>1</sup>

And here things become complicated, as human minds are wont to do—I think even Dennett oversimplifies how this psychology works in practice. For one thing, if you believe in belief, you cannot admit to yourself that you merely believe in belief. What’s virtuous is to believe, not to believe in believing; and so if you only believe in belief, instead of believing, you are not virtuous. Nobody will admit to themselves, “I don’t believe the Ultimate Cosmic Sky is blue and green, but I believe I ought to believe it”—not unless they are unusually capable of acknowledging their own lack of virtue. People don’t believe in belief in belief, they just believe in belief.

(Those who find this confusing may find it helpful to study mathematical logic, which trains one to make very sharp distinctions between the proposition P, a proof of P, and a proof that P is provable. There are similarly sharp distinctions between P, wanting P, believing P, wanting to believe P, and believing that you believe P.)

There are different kinds of belief in belief. You may believe in belief explicitly; you may recite in your deliberate stream of consciousness the verbal sentence “It is virtuous to believe that the Ultimate Cosmic Sky is perfectly blue and perfectly green.” (While also believing that you believe this, unless you are unusually capable of acknowledging your own lack of virtue.) But there are also less explicit forms of belief in belief. Maybe the dragon-claimant fears the public ridicule that they imagine will result if they publicly confess they were wrong.<sup>2</sup> Maybe the dragon-claimant flinches away from the prospect of admitting to themselves that there is no dragon, because it conflicts with their self-image as the glorious discoverer of the dragon, who saw in their garage what all others had failed to see.

If all our thoughts were deliberate verbal sentences like philosophers manipulate, the human mind would be a great deal easier for humans to understand. Fleeting mental images, unspoken flinches, desires acted upon without acknowledgement—these account for as much of ourselves as words.

While I disagree with Dennett on some details and complications, I still think that Dennett’s notion of belief in belief is the key insight necessary to understand the dragon-claimant. But we need a wider concept of belief, not limited to verbal sentences. “Belief” should include unspoken anticipationcontrollers. “Belief in belief” should include unspoken cognitive-behaviorguiders. It is not psychologically realistic to say, “The dragon-claimant does not believe there is a dragon in their garage; they believe it is beneficial to believe there is a dragon in their garage.” But it is realistic to say the dragon-claimant anticipates as if there is no dragon in their garage, and makes excuses as if they believed in the belief.

You can possess an ordinary mental picture of your garage, with no dragons in it, which correctly predicts your experiences on opening the door, and never once think the verbal phrase There is no dragon in my garage. I even bet it’s happened to you—that when you open your garage door or bedroom door or whatever, and expect to see no dragons, no such verbal phrase runs through your mind.

And to flinch away from giving up your belief in the dragon—or flinch away from giving up your self-image as a person who believes in the dragon— it is not necessary to explicitly think I want to believe there’s a dragon in my garage. It is only necessary to flinch away from the prospect of admitting you don’t believe.

If someone believes in their belief in the dragon, and also believes in the dragon, the problem is much less severe. They will be willing to stick their neck out on experimental predictions, and perhaps even agree to give up the belief if the experimental prediction is wrong.3 But when someone makes up excuses in advance, it would seem to require that belief and belief in belief have become unsynchronized.
