## 科学与政治的寓言

在罗马帝国时期，市民生活被蓝党和绿党分割。蓝党和绿党在单挑、埋伏、群战和骚乱中互相残杀。普罗科皮乌斯这样描述这些交战派别：“他们对同胞产生了一种无缘无故的敌意，这种敌意从未停止或消失，不会因婚姻、亲情或友谊而让步，即使是兄弟或其他亲属，只要在颜色上有分歧，情况也一样。”<sup>1</sup> 爱德华·吉本写道：“获得派别的支持成了每个竞选公职或教职者的必需。”<sup>2</sup>

蓝党和绿党是谁？他们是体育迷——支持蓝队和绿队战车比赛的人。

想象一个未来社会，人们逃入庞大的地下洞穴网络，并封住了入口。我们不必说明他们是为了躲避疾病、战争还是辐射；只需假设最初的地下居民成功种植食物、找到水源、循环空气、制造光亮并生存下来，后代繁衍生息，最终形成城市。关于地面世界，只剩下写在纸片上的传说；其中一张纸片描述了天空——一片广阔无垠的空气，悬于巨大无边的地面之上。天空是蔚蓝色的，里面漂浮着像巨大棉团一样奇异的白色物体。但“蔚蓝色”这个词的含义存在争议；有人说它指的是“蓝色”，有人说它指的是“绿色”。

在地下社会的早期，蓝党和绿党曾公开暴力冲突；但如今，休战了——一种源于无意义感增长的和平。文化风俗已变；一个庞大而富裕的中产阶级在有效执法下成长起来，已不习惯暴力。学校提供了一些历史视角：蓝绿之争持续了多久，死了多少人，结果却几乎没有改变。人们的思想开始接受一种新奇的哲学：无论是蓝党还是绿党，人都是人。

冲突并未消失。社会依然沿着蓝绿分界线分裂，几乎每一个当代重要的政治或文化议题上都有“蓝方立场”和“绿方立场”。蓝党主张对个人收入征税，绿党主张对商人销售征税；蓝党主张更严格的婚姻法，绿党则希望离婚更容易；蓝党的支持来自城市核心，而更远的农民和卖水者多为绿党；蓝党认为地球是宇宙中心的一块巨大球形岩石，绿党则认为地球是围绕某个叫太阳的物体旋转的巨大平坦岩石。并非每个蓝党或绿党公民在每个议题上都持本党立场，但很少有城市商人既相信天空是蓝色，又主张个人税和更自由的婚姻法。

地下世界依然两极分化，和平而不安。少数人真心认为蓝党和绿党应该成为朋友，如今绿党人光顾蓝党商店、蓝党人去绿党酒馆已很常见。然而，最初因疲惫而生的休战，正悄然孕育出宽容，甚至友谊的精神。

有一天，地下世界发生了一次小地震。六人观光团在上层洞穴参观古代遗迹时遇到震动。他们感到脚下岩石短暂晃动，一名游客绊倒擦伤了膝盖。大家决定返回，担心还有余震。回程中，有人闻到一股奇异的气味，来自一条久未使用的通道。无视同伴的善意劝阻，这个人借来一盏电灯，走进了通道。石廊一路向上……再向上……最终通向世界尽头的一个洞口，那里岩石终结。无尽的距离向外延展，足以容纳千座城市。不可思议的高空中，有一道耀眼的光芒，无法直视，像某个巨大灯泡的裸露灯丝，照亮了所有可见空间。空中悬浮着巨大难解的白色棉团。而那广阔发光的穹顶……它的颜色是……

此时，历史分岔，取决于观光团中谁走上了通道，来到地表。

蓝党人阿迪提娅站在无尽的蓝色之下，慢慢地笑了。这不是愉快的笑容，而是带着仇恨和受伤的自尊，回忆起她与绿党每一次争论、每一次竞争、每一次晋升之争。“你一直都是对的，”天空在她耳边低语，“现在你可以证明了。”阿迪提娅站在那里，沉浸在这信息中，陶醉其中，然后转身回到石廊，准备告诉全世界。她握紧拳头说：“休战结束了。”

绿党人巴伦茫然地凝视着混乱的色彩，良久才明白过来，理解如重锤击中腹部，泪水涌上眼眶。巴伦想起了卡泰大屠杀，蓝军屠杀了绿镇的所有居民，包括儿童；想起了古代蓝军将军安纳斯·雷尔，曾称绿党人为“疾病之坑，必须清除的瘟疫”；想起了蓝党人眼中的仇恨光芒，内心某处崩溃了。“你怎么能站在他们那边？”巴伦对天空怒吼，随即痛哭，因为他知道，站在这恶意的蓝光下，宇宙一直都是邪恶的地方。

蓝党人查尔斯惊讶地看着蓝色穹顶。作为一所混合学院的教授，查尔斯一直强调蓝绿观点同样有效、值得宽容：天空是形而上构造，蔚蓝色可以有多种理解。查尔斯短暂地想，也许一个绿党人在这里会看到绿色的穹顶，或者明天这个穹顶会变绿；但他不能把文明的存续押在这上面。这只是某种自然现象，与道德哲学或社会无关……但查尔斯担心，这很容易被误解。他叹了口气，转身回到通道。明天他会独自回来，封住这个入口。

曾为绿党的达莉娅在世界的灰烬中努力呼吸。我不会退缩，达莉娅对自己说，我不会回避。她一生都是绿党人，现在必须成为蓝党。她的朋友、家人都会离她而去。父亲曾告诉她：“即使声音颤抖，也要说出真相”；但父亲已故，母亲永远不会理解。达莉娅直视天空平静的蓝色，努力接受现实，终于呼吸平稳。她悲伤地对自己说：我错了，其实并不复杂。她会找到新朋友，也许家人会原谅她……或者，她带着一丝希望想，也许他们也会接受同样的考验，站在同一片天空下？“天空是蓝色的，”达莉娅试探着说，什么坏事也没发生；但她还是笑不出来。蓝党人达莉娅叹息着回到世界，思索着该如何开口。

绿党人埃丁仰望蓝天，讥讽地大笑起来。他终于看清了世界历史的走向，连他自己都不敢相信大家竟然如此愚蠢。“愚蠢，愚蠢，愚蠢，这一切其实一直就在这里。”仇恨、杀戮、战争，而这一切其实只是某个地方的一个东西，有人像写别的东西一样写下了它。没有诗意，没有美感，没有任何理智的人会在意的东西，只是一个被无限夸大的无意义之物。埃丁倚在洞口，疲惫地思考如何防止这个消息引发世界大乱，也怀疑大家是否都活该。

费里斯不由自主地倒吸一口气，被纯粹的惊奇和喜悦定住了。费里斯的目光饥渴地扫视着每一样景象，依依不舍地从一个转向下一个：蓝天、白云、广阔未知的外部世界，那里有无数地方和事物（还有人？），是任何地下人都未曾见过的。“哦，原来是这个颜色啊，”费里斯说，然后踏上了探索之旅。

## A Fable of Science and Politics

In the time of the Roman Empire, civic life was divided between the Blue and Green factions. The Blues and the Greens murdered each other in single combats, in ambushes, in group battles, in riots. Procopius said of the warring factions: “So there grows up in them against their fellow men a hostility which has no cause, and at no time does it cease or disappear, for it gives place neither to the ties of marriage nor of relationship nor of friendship, and the case is the same even though those who differ with respect to these colors be brothers or any other kin.”<sup>1</sup> Edward Gibbon wrote: “The support of a faction became necessary to every candidate for civil or ecclesiastical honors.”<sup>2</sup>

Who were the Blues and the Greens? They were sports fans—the partisans of the blue and green chariot-racing teams.

Imagine a future society that flees into a vast underground network of caverns and seals the entrances. We shall not specify whether they flee disease, war, or radiation; we shall suppose the first Undergrounders manage to grow food, find water, recycle air, make light, and survive, and that their descendants thrive and eventually form cities. Of the world above, there are only legends written on scraps of paper; and one of these scraps of paper describes the sky, a vast open space of air above a great unbounded floor. The sky is cerulean in color, and contains strange floating objects like enormous tufts of white cotton. But the meaning of the word “cerulean” is controversial; some say that it refers to the color known as “blue,” and others that it refers to the color known as “green.”

In the early days of the underground society, the Blues and Greens contested with open violence; but today, truce prevails—a peace born of a growing sense of pointlessness. Cultural mores have changed; there is a large and prosperous middle class that has grown up with effective law enforcement and become unaccustomed to violence. The schools provide some sense of historical perspective; how long the battle between Blues and Greens continued, how many died, how little changed as a result. Minds have been laid open to the strange new philosophy that people are people, whether they be Blue or Green.

The conflict has not vanished. Society is still divided along Blue and Green lines, and there is a “Blue” and a “Green” position on almost every contemporary issue of political or cultural importance. The Blues advocate taxes on individual incomes, the Greens advocate taxes on merchant sales; the Blues advocate stricter marriage laws, while the Greens wish to make it easier to obtain divorces; the Blues take their support from the heart of city areas, while the more distant farmers and watersellers tend to be Green; the Blues believe that the Earth is a huge spherical rock at the center of the universe, the Greens that it is a huge flat rock circling some other object called a Sun. Not every Blue or every Green citizen takes the “Blue” or “Green” position on every issue, but it would be rare to find a city merchant who believed the sky was blue, and yet advocated an individual tax and freer marriage laws.

The Underground is still polarized; an uneasy peace. A few folk genuinely think that Blues and Greens should be friends, and it is now common for a Green to patronize a Blue shop, or for a Blue to visit a Green tavern. Yet from a truce originally born of exhaustion, there is a quietly growing spirit of tolerance, even friendship.

One day, the Underground is shaken by a minor earthquake. A sightseeing party of six is caught in the tremblor while looking at the ruins of ancient dwellings in the upper caverns. They feel the brief movement of the rock under their feet, and one of the tourists trips and scrapes her knee. The party decides to turn back, fearing further earthquakes. On their way back, one person catches a whiff of something strange in the air, a scent coming from a long-unused passageway. Ignoring the well-meant cautions of fellow travellers, the person borrows a powered lantern and walks into the passageway. The stone corridor wends upward . . . and upward . . . and finally terminates in a hole carved out of the world, a place where all stone ends. Distance, endless distance, stretches away into forever; a gathering space to hold a thousand cities. Unimaginably far above, too bright to look at directly, a searing spark casts light over all visible space, the naked filament of some huge light bulb. In the air, hanging unsupported, are great incomprehensible tufts of white cotton. And the vast glowing ceiling above . . . the color . . . is . . .

Now history branches, depending on which member of the sightseeing party decided to follow the corridor to the surface.

Aditya the Blue stood under the blue forever, and slowly smiled. It was not a pleasant smile. There was hatred, and wounded pride; it recalled every argument she’d ever had with a Green, every rivalry, every contested promotion. “You were right all along,” the sky whispered down at her, “and now you can prove it.” For a moment Aditya stood there, absorbing the message, glorying in it, and then she turned back to the stone corridor to tell the world. As Aditya walked, she curled her hand into a clenched fist. “The truce,” she said, “is over.”

Barron the Green stared uncomprehendingly at the chaos of colors for long seconds. Understanding, when it came, drove a pile-driver punch into the pit of his stomach. Tears started from his eyes. Barron thought of the Massacre of Cathay, where a Blue army had massacred every citizen of a Green town, including children; he thought of the ancient Blue general, Annas Rell, who had declared Greens “a pit of disease; a pestilence to be cleansed”; he thought of the glints of hatred he’d seen in Blue eyes and something inside him cracked. “How can you be on their side?” Barron screamed at the sky, and then he began to weep; because he knew, standing under the malevolent blue glare, that the universe had always been a place of evil.

Charles the Blue considered the blue ceiling, taken aback. As a professor in a mixed college, Charles had carefully emphasized that Blue and Green viewpoints were equally valid and deserving of tolerance: The sky was a metaphysical construct, and cerulean a color that could be seen in more than one way. Briefly, Charles wondered whether a Green, standing in this place, might not see a green ceiling above; or if perhaps the ceiling would be green at this time tomorrow; but he couldn’t stake the continued survival of civilization on that. This was merely a natural phenomenon of some kind, having nothing to do with moral philosophy or society . . . but one that might be readily misinterpreted, Charles feared. Charles sighed, and turned to go back into the corridor. Tomorrow he would come back alone and block off the passageway.

Daria, once Green, tried to breathe amid the ashes of her world. I will not flinch, Daria told herself, I will not look away. She had been Green all her life, and now she must be Blue. Her friends, her family, would turn from her. Speak the truth, even if your voice trembles, her father had told her; but her father was dead now, and her mother would never understand. Daria stared down the calm blue gaze of the sky, trying to accept it, and finally her breathing quietened. I was wrong, she said to herself mournfully; it’s not so complicated, after all. She would find new friends, and perhaps her family would forgive her . . . or, she wondered with a tinge of hope, rise to this same test, standing underneath this same sky? “The sky is blue,” Daria said experimentally, and nothing dire happened to her; but she couldn’t bring herself to smile. Daria the Blue exhaled sadly, and went back into the world, wondering what she would say.

Eddin, a Green, looked up at the blue sky and began to laugh cynically. The course of his world’s history came clear at last; even he couldn’t believe they’d been such fools. “Stupid,” Eddin said, “stupid, stupid, and all the time it was right here.” Hatred, murders, wars, and all along it was just a thing somewhere, that someone had written about like they’d write about any other thing. No poetry, no beauty, nothing that any sane person would ever care about, just one pointless thing that had been blown out of all proportion. Eddin leaned against the cave mouth wearily, trying to think of a way to prevent this information from blowing up the world, and wondering if they didn’t all deserve it.

Ferris gasped involuntarily, frozen by sheer wonder and delight. Ferris’s eyes darted hungrily about, fastening on each sight in turn before moving reluctantly to the next; the blue sky, the white clouds, the vast unknown outside, full of places and things (and people?) that no Undergrounder had ever seen. “Oh, so that’s what color it is,” Ferris said, and went exploring.
