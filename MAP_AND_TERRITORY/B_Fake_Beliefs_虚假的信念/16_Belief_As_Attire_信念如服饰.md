## 信念如服饰

到目前为止，我已经区分了“作为预期控制器的信念”、“相信信念”、“宣称信仰”和“呐喊助威”。其中，我们可以把“预期控制型信念”称为“真正的信念”，而其他形式则是“非真正的信念”。一个真正的信念也可能是错误或非理性的，比如有人真心预期祈祷能治愈自己生病的孩子。而其他形式，严格来说甚至“算不上信念”。

还有一种非真正信念的形式，就是“作为群体认同的信念”——即归属感。罗宾·汉森用“穿着特殊服饰”的比喻来形容，比如神职人员的法衣或犹太人的小圆帽，所以我称之为“信念如服饰”。

从现实心理学的角度来看，驾驶飞机撞向世贸中心的穆斯林，毫无疑问是把自己视为捍卫真理、正义和伊斯兰道路的英雄，就像电影《独立日》里对抗可怕外星怪物的英雄一样。只有极其缺乏社会经验的书呆子，才会在阿拉巴马的酒吧里把这些话说出来。这不是美国人会说的话。美国人会说，恐怖分子“憎恨我们的自由”，把飞机撞向大楼是“懦夫的行为”。你不能在同一句话里同时说“英勇的自我牺牲”和“自杀式炸弹袭击者”，即使只是为了准确描述敌人眼中的世界观也不行。“自杀式炸弹袭击者的勇气和利他主义”这个概念，是“敌人的服饰”——你能分辨出来，因为敌人才会这样说。而“自杀式炸弹袭击者的懦弱和反社会”，则是“美国的服饰”。你无法用引号来描述敌人如何看待世界；那就像万圣节穿纳粹制服一样。

“信念如服饰”也许能解释为什么人们会对非真正的信念如此热情。仅仅是“相信信念”或“宗教宣称”，很难产生真正深刻而强烈的情感效应。至少我猜是这样；我承认我不是这方面的专家。但我的印象是：那些已经不再像真的那样预期自己宗教为真的人，会极力说服自己自己很有激情，这种绝望有时会被误认为是激情。但那已经不是他们童年时的那团火焰了。

另一方面，人类很容易真诚、热烈、发自内心地归属于一个群体，为自己喜欢的运动队呐喊助威。<sup>1</sup> 认同一个部落是一种极其强大的情感力量。人们会为此而死。一旦你让人们认同某个部落，这个部落的“服饰信念”就会被他们用全部归属感去表达。

## Belief as Attire

I have so far distinguished between belief as anticipation-controller, belief in belief, professing, and cheering. Of these, we might call anticipationcontrolling beliefs “proper beliefs” and the other forms “improper beliefs.” A proper belief can be wrong or irrational, as when someone genuinely anticipates that prayer will cure their sick baby. But the other forms are arguably “not belief at all.”

Yet another form of improper belief is belief as group identification—as a way of belonging. Robin Hanson uses the excellent metaphor of wearing unusual clothing, a group uniform like a priest’s vestments or a Jewish skullcap, and so I will call this “belief as attire.”

In terms of humanly realistic psychology, the Muslims who flew planes into the World Trade Center undoubtedly saw themselves as heroes defending truth, justice, and the Islamic Way from hideous alien monsters a la the movie Independence Day. Only a very inexperienced nerd, the sort of nerd who has no idea how non-nerds see the world, would say this out loud in an Alabama bar. It is not an American thing to say. The American thing to say is that the terrorists “hate our freedom” and that flying a plane into a building is a “cowardly act.” You cannot say the phrases “heroic self-sacrifice” and “suicide bomber” in the same sentence, even for the sake of accurately describing how the Enemy sees the world. The very concept of the courage and altruism of a suicide bomber is Enemy attire—you can tell, because the Enemy talks about it. The cowardice and sociopathy of a suicide bomber is American attire. There are no quote marks you can use to talk about how the Enemy sees the world; it would be like dressing up as a Nazi for Halloween.

Belief-as-attire may help explain how people can be passionate about improper beliefs. Mere belief in belief, or religious professing, would have some trouble creating genuine, deep, powerful emotional effects. Or so I suspect; I confess I’m not an expert here. But my impression is this: People who’ve stopped anticipating-as-if their religion is true, will go to great lengths to convince themselves they are passionate, and this desperation can be mistaken for passion. But it’s not the same fire they had as a child.

On the other hand, it is very easy for a human being to genuinely, passionately, gut-level belong to a group, to cheer for their favorite sports team.<sup>1</sup> Identifying with a tribe is a very strong emotional force. People will die for it. And once you get people to identify with a tribe, the beliefs which are attire of that tribe will be spoken with the full passion of belonging to that tribe.
