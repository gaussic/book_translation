## “科学”作为好奇心终止符

想象一下，我在现场直播的电视镜头前，举起双手，念出“阿布拉卡达布拉”，在我伸出的手之外的空中凭空创造出一道耀眼的光芒。假如我在詹姆斯·兰迪和所有怀疑论者的全程监督下，公然、毫无疑问地施展了魔法。我想，大多数人都会非常好奇到底发生了什么。

但现在假设我没有上电视。我不想分享这种力量，也不想透露背后的真相。我想把魔法保密。但我又想随时随地施展魔法。比如，我想在火车上读书时召唤出明亮的光芒——而且不希望有人对此产生好奇。有这样的咒语吗，能阻止别人的好奇心？

当然有！每当有人问“你是怎么做到的？”我只需说一句：“科学！”

这并不是真正的解释，更像是好奇心的终止符。它不会告诉你这道光会变亮还是变暗，会不会改变色调或饱和度，更不会告诉你如何自己制造出类似的光。除了我说出这个魔法词之外，你其实并没有比之前知道得更多。但你会转身离开，心满意足地觉得没什么特别的。

更妙的是，这个把戏在普通的电灯开关上同样有效。

按下开关，灯泡就亮了。为什么？

在学校里，我们被教导，点亮灯泡的“密码”是“电！”但现在，我希望你已经警觉，不要因为听到“电！”就觉得灯泡“已经理解了”。说“电！”能让你做出能控制体验预期的计算吗？至少，还有很多东西值得学习。<sup>1</sup>

如果你认为灯泡是科学无法解释的，那它会完全吸引你的注意力。你会放下手头的一切，全神贯注地研究这个灯泡。

但“科学可以解释”这句话到底是什么意思？它的意思是，有别人知道灯泡是怎么工作的。当你被告知灯泡“可以用科学解释”时，你并没有比之前知道得更多；你并不知道灯泡会不会变亮。只是因为有人知道，所以在你眼中，这份知识的价值就降低了。你的好奇心也随之减弱。

有人一定会说：“如果灯泡是科学未知的，你可以通过研究它成名致富。”但我说的不是贪婪，也不是职业野心。我说的是纯粹的好奇心——那种被吸引的感觉。为什么仅仅因为别人（不是你）知道灯泡的原理，你的好奇心就会减弱？这难道不是一种嫉妒？光你自己知道还不够，别人也必须无知你才高兴？

知识除了满足好奇心之外，还有其他用途，比如技术的社会效用。对于这些工具性价值，别人是否已经知道确实很重要。但对我自己的好奇心来说，为什么要在意别人知不知道？

再想想，如果你允许“别人已经知道答案”成为好奇心终止符，会有什么后果。有一天你走进客厅，看到一头巨大的绿色大象悬浮在半空中，周围环绕着银色的光环。

“这是什么鬼？”你说。

然后大象上方传来一个声音：

> 已经有人知道这头大象为什么在这里。

“哦，”你说，“那没事了。”然后走进厨房。

我并不知道这个宇宙物理定律的终极大统一理论。我对人体解剖学也知之甚少，除了大脑以外。我甚至说不出我的肾脏在哪里，也记不清肝脏的具体功能。<sup>2</sup>

就好奇心而言，我应该对自己不知道终极物理定律更感兴趣，还是对自己不了解身体内部发生的事情更感兴趣？

如果我举手施展光之魔法，你会觉得好奇。那么，当你自己举手挥动时，难道不该同样好奇吗？你挥手的动作，是由（包括小脑在内的）大脑区域协调完成的。我敢打赌你并不知道小脑是怎么工作的。我只知道一点点——只是粗略的细节，远远不够做出计算……但那又怎样？如果你不知道，这又有什么关系？为什么对魔法和挥手动作的好奇心要有双重标准？

看看镜子里的自己。你知道你在看什么吗？你知道是谁在你眼睛后面看着这个世界吗？你知道你是什么吗？这些问题，有些科学已经知道答案，有些还不知道。但如果你自己不知道，这种区别对你的好奇心来说又有什么意义？

你知道你的膝盖是怎么工作的吗？你知道你的鞋子是怎么做出来的吗？你知道为什么你的显示器会发光吗？你知道为什么水是湿的吗？

你身边的世界充满了谜题。如果你必须，可以优先排序。但请不要抱怨残酷的科学让世界失去了神秘。用这种理由，我甚至能让你忽略客厅里的大象。

<sup>1</sup>物理学家请无视本段，换成进化论的问题吧，在那里理论的实质同样体现在只有少数人能做的计算中。

<sup>2</sup>我并不为此自豪。唉，要学的数学太多，短期内我恐怕也没机会学解剖学了。

## “Science” as Curiosity-Stopper

Imagine that I, in full view of live television cameras, raised my hands and chanted abracadabra and caused a brilliant light to be born, flaring in empty space beyond my outstretched hands. Imagine that I committed this act of blatant, unmistakeable sorcery under the full supervision of James Randi and all skeptical armies. Most people, I think, would be fairly curious as to what was going on.

But now suppose instead that I don’t go on television. I do not wish to share the power, nor the truth behind it. I want to keep my sorcery secret. And yet I also want to cast my spells whenever and wherever I please. I want to cast my brilliant flare of light so that I can read a book on the train—without anyone becoming curious. Is there a spell that stops curiosity?

Yes indeed! Whenever anyone asks “How did you do that?” I just say “Science!”

It’s not a real explanation, so much as a curiosity-stopper. It doesn’t tell you whether the light will brighten or fade, change color in hue or saturation, and it certainly doesn’t tell you how to make a similar light yourself. You don’t actually know anything more than you knew before I said the magic word. But you turn away, satisfied that nothing unusual is going on.

Better yet, the same trick works with a standard light switch.

Flip a switch and a light bulb turns on. Why?

In school, one is taught that the password to the light bulb is “Electricity!” By now, I hope, you’re wary of marking the light bulb “understood” on such a basis. Does saying “Electricity!” let you do calculations that will control your anticipation of experience? There is, at the least, a great deal more to learn.<sup>1</sup>

If you thought the light bulb was scientifically inexplicable, it would seize the entirety of your attention. You would drop whatever else you were doing, and focus on that light bulb.

But what does the phrase “scientifically explicable” mean? It means that someone else knows how the light bulb works. When you are told the light bulb is “scientifically explicable,” you don’t know more than you knew earlier; you don’t know whether the light bulb will brighten or fade. But because someone else knows, it devalues the knowledge in your eyes. You become less curious.

Someone is bound to say, “If the light bulb were unknown to science, you could gain fame and fortune by investigating it.” But I’m not talking about greed. I’m not talking about career ambition. I’m talking about the raw emotion of curiosity—the feeling of being intrigued. Why should your curiosity be diminished because someone else, not you, knows how the light bulb works? Is this not spite? It’s not enough for you to know; other people must also be ignorant, or you won’t be happy?

There are goods that knowledge may serve besides curiosity, such as the social utility of technology. For these instrumental goods, it matters whether some other entity in local space already knows. But for my own curiosity, why should it matter?

Besides, consider the consequences if you permit “Someone else knows the answer” to function as a curiosity-stopper. One day you walk into your living room and see a giant green elephant, seemingly hovering in midair, surrounded by an aura of silver light.

“What the heck?” you say.

And a voice comes from above the elephant, saying,

> SOMEBODY ALREADY KNOWS WHY THIS ELEPHANT IS HERE.

“Oh,” you say, “in that case, never mind,” and walk on to the kitchen.

I don’t know the grand unified theory for this universe’s laws of physics. I also don’t know much about human anatomy with the exception of the brain. I couldn’t point out on my body where my kidneys are, and I can’t recall offhand what my liver does.2

Should I, so far as curiosity is concerned, be more intrigued by my ignorance of the ultimate laws of physics, than the fact that I don’t know much about what goes on inside my own body?

If I raised my hands and cast a light spell, you would be intrigued. Should you be any less intrigued by the very fact that I raised my hands? When you raise your arm and wave a hand around, this act of will is coordinated by (among other brain areas) your cerebellum. I bet you don’t know how the cerebellum works. I know a little—though only the gross details, not enough to perform calculations . . . but so what? What does that matter, if you don’t know? Why should there be a double standard of curiosity for sorcery and hand motions?

Look at yourself in the mirror. Do you know what you’re looking at? Do you know what looks out from behind your eyes? Do you know what you are? Some of that answer Science knows, and some of it Science does not. But why should that distinction matter to your curiosity, if you don’t know?

Do you know how your knees work? Do you know how your shoes were made? Do you know why your computer monitor glows? Do you know why water is wet?

The world around you is full of puzzles. Prioritize, if you must. But do not complain that cruel Science has emptied the world of mystery. With reasoning such as that, I could get you to overlook an elephant in your living room.
