## 未能从历史中吸取教训

很久很久以前，在我那狂野而鲁莽的青春岁月里，在我还不懂贝叶斯之道的时候，我曾经对一个看似神秘的问题给出了一个神秘的答案。许多失败接连发生，但有一个错误最为关键：年少的我没有意识到，解决一个谜团应该让它变得不那么令人困惑。我当时试图解释一个神秘现象——对我来说，这意味着为它找到一个原因，把它纳入现实的整体模型中。但为什么这样做会让这个现象变得不那么神秘呢？毕竟神秘正是它的本质。我试图解释神秘现象，而不是（通过某种不可能的炼金术）把它变成一个平凡的现象——一个本来就不需要特殊解释的现象。

作为一个传统理性主义者，我知道占星家与天文学、炼金术士与化学、活力论者与生物学的历史故事。但这个神秘现象似乎并不一样。它是新的，更奇怪，更难以理解，是普通科学几个世纪以来都未能解释的东西——

——仿佛星辰、物质和生命在几百年、几千年里，从人类思想的黎明直到科学最终解决它们之前，都不是谜团一样——

我们在学校里学习天文学、化学和生物学，这让我们觉得这些领域一直都是科学的正当领域，从未有过神秘。当科学敢于挑战一个新的伟大谜题时，那一代的孩子们会持怀疑态度，因为他们从未见过科学解释他们自己觉得神秘的东西。科学只擅长解释科学课题，比如星辰、物质和生命。

我曾以为历史的教训是：占星家、炼金术士和活力论者有某种与生俱来的性格缺陷，一种神秘主义倾向，导致他们为非神秘的事物编造神秘的解释。但我想，如果一个现象真的非常怪异，也许确实需要一个怪异的解释？

直到后来，当我开始在谜团中看到平凡的结构时，我才意识到自己正站在谁的鞋子里。直到那时，我才明白活力论在当时看起来有多合理，而宇宙的回答——“生命其实很平凡，不需要奇怪的解释”——又是多么令人惊讶和尴尬。

我们读历史，却没有亲身经历历史，没有亲身体验。如果我曾亲自假设过占星的谜团，然后发现了牛顿力学，假设过炼金术的谜团，然后发现了化学，假设过活力论的谜团，然后发现了生物学，那么当我想到自己的神秘答案时，我一定会对自己说：我绝不会再上这种当了。

## Failing to Learn from History

Once upon a time, in my reckless youth, when I knew not the Way of Bayes, I gave a Mysterious Answer to a mysterious-seeming question. Many failures occurred in sequence, but one mistake stands out as most critical: My younger self did not realize that solving a mystery should make it feel less confusing. I was trying to explain a Mysterious Phenomenon—which to me meant providing a cause for it, fitting it into an integrated model of reality. Why should this make the phenomenon less Mysterious, when that is its nature? I was trying to explain the Mysterious Phenomenon, not render it (by some impossible alchemy) into a mundane phenomenon, a phenomenon that wouldn’t even call out for an unusual explanation in the first place.

As a Traditional Rationalist, I knew the historical tales of astrologers and astronomy, of alchemists and chemistry, of vitalists and biology. But the Mysterious Phenomenon was not like this. It was something new, something stranger, something more difficult, something that ordinary science had failed to explain for centuries—

—as if stars and matter and life had not been mysteries for hundreds of years and thousands of years, from the dawn of human thought right up until science finally solved them—

We learn about astronomy and chemistry and biology in school, and it seems to us that these matters have always been the proper realm of science, that they have never been mysterious. When science dares to challenge a new Great Puzzle, the children of that generation are skeptical, for they have never seen science explain something that feels mysterious to them. Science is only good for explaining scientific subjects, like stars and matter and life.

I thought the lesson of history was that astrologers and alchemists and vitalists had an innate character flaw, a tendency toward mysterianism, which led them to come up with mysterious explanations for non-mysterious subjects. But surely, if a phenomenon really was very weird, a weird explanation might be in order?

It was only afterward, when I began to see the mundane structure inside the mystery, that I realized whose shoes I was standing in. Only then did I realize how reasonable vitalism had seemed at the time, how surprising and embarrassing had been the universe’s reply of, “Life is mundane, and does not need a weird explanation.”

We read history but we don’t live it, we don’t experience it. If only I had personally postulated astrological mysteries and then discovered Newtonian mechanics, postulated alchemical mysteries and then discovered chemistry, postulated vitalistic mysteries and then discovered biology. I would have thought of my Mysterious Answer and said to myself: No way am I falling for that again.
