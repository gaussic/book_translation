## 前言

你现在手中拿着的是我两年每日博客文章的合集。回顾这个项目，我发现自己做错了很多事情。对此我并不介意。如果回头看时没有发现大量错误，那就意味着自2009年以来，我的写作和理解都没有进步。每当我们改进自己的信念和策略时，都会发出“哎呀”这样的声音；所以如果回头看过去，发现自己没有做错任何事，那就说明你从那时起什么都没学到，也没有改变过想法。

我没有以帮助人们在日常生活中做得更好为目标来写这两年的博客文章，这是一个错误。我写这些文章时的目标，是帮助人们解决那些重大、困难、重要的问题，并且我选择的例子也都是听起来很厉害、很抽象的问题。

回头看，这其实是我方法上的第二大错误。它和我写作中的第一大错误有关，那就是我没有意识到，学习这种宝贵思维方式的最大难题在于如何实践它，而不是掌握理论。我没有意识到实践才是优先事项；对此我只能说一句“哎呀”和“呃”。

是的，有时候那些重大问题确实很重大、也确实很重要；但这并不改变一个基本事实：要掌握一项技能，你需要不断练习，而在距离自己较远的事情上进行练习则更为困难。（如今，应用理性中心正在以更系统的方式修正我这个巨大的错误。）

我犯的第三个重大错误是过于关注理性信念，而对理性行动关注太少。第四大错误是我本应该更好地组织我在系列文章中呈现的内容。尤其是，我本应该更早地创建一个维基，并让大家更容易按顺序阅读这些文章。

至少这个错误是可以纠正的。在本书中，Rob Bensinger 已经对这些文章进行了重新排序和整理，在不试图重写所有原始内容的前提下，尽可能地进行了调整（虽然他对其中一部分内容做了一些改写）。

我犯的第五个重大错误是——在我看来——我试图直言不讳地指出那些在我看来很愚蠢的观点的愚蠢之处。我确实尽量避免了“布尔弗主义”这种谬误，也就是一上来就讨论相信某事的人有多愚蠢；我总是先讨论问题本身，然后才说“所以这很愚蠢”。但在2009年，我心里还在思考，是否有必要让一些人公开表达对顺势疗法的蔑视。我认为（现在依然认为）存在这样一个不幸的问题：对观点的礼貌对待，会被很多人下意识地理解为“如果我说我相信这个，也不会有什么坏事发生；如果我说我相信顺势疗法，也不会失去地位”，而喜剧演员的嘲笑有时能帮助人们从这种梦境中醒来。

今天的话，我会写得更有礼貌一些。我认为，过去的不礼貌确实起到了一定作用，也确实有些读者因此受益；但现在我更加严肃地看待这样一个风险：如果一个社区对低地位的外来观点的常态和预期反应是公开的嘲讽和蔑视，这会带来不良后果。

尽管我犯了错误，但我很高兴地说，到目前为止，我的读者们在没有把我的言辞当作欺凌或贬低他人的借口方面表现得非常好。（我特别想提到 Scott Alexander，他比我更友善，也是这些话题上越来越出色的写作者，也许他应当为让 Less Wrong 社区文化保持健康承担一部分功劳。）

能够回头说自己“失败”了，这本身就意味着你曾经有过目标。那么，我当时到底想要做什么呢？

有一种宝贵的思维方式，直到今天还没有在学校里教授。这种思维方式根本没有被系统地传授。它只是被那些从小阅读《费曼先生，您开玩笑吧》这类书籍的人，或者在高中遇到极为优秀老师的人所自然而然地吸收。

最著名的，这种思维方式与科学和实验方法有关。科学中有一部分，是你走出去观察宇宙，而不是凭空想象。还有一部分，是当实验结果不支持某个理论时，你会说“哎呀”，然后放弃这个糟糕的理论。

但这种思维方式并不仅限于此。它比你进实验室时戴上的护目镜、离开时摘下来的护目镜更深刻、更普遍。它同样适用于日常生活，尽管这一部分更加微妙，也更难把握。但如果你无法在发现某事行不通时说一句“哎呀”并放弃它，你就只能不断地自食其果。你只能不断地给猎枪上膛，不断地扣动扳机。你一定见过这样的人。而在你生活中的某个地方、某个你不愿回想的角落，你自己也曾是这样的人。如果有一种思维方式能帮助我们停止这种行为，那该多好。

尽管我犯下的错误如此之大，这两年的博客写作似乎还是在出人意料的程度上帮助了出人意料多的人。它并不是总能奏效，但有时候确实有效。

在现代社会中，关于理性信念和决策技能的教育极为稀少，相关的数学和科学基础知识也很少被教授……结果就是，仅仅阅读一大堆充满哲学和科学问题的“头脑风暴”，实际上对你来说真的会有意想不到的好处。从十几个不同的角度走一遍这些内容，有时能让你隐约感受到其中的核心节奏。

因为归根结底，这一切其实都是同一回事。我谈论了那些重大、重要、遥远的问题，却忽视了眼前的生活，但支配它们的规律其实并没有什么不同。我关注的部分有巨大的空白，选的例子也全都错了；但归根结底，这一切都是同一个东西。即便我犯了那么多错误，即便我无数次说出“哎呀”，我依然为自己能够回头说出这些话而感到自豪……

即使在五年之后，我依然觉得，这总比什么都没有要好。

## Preface 

You hold in your hands a compilation of two years of daily blog posts. In retrospect, I look back on that project and see a large number of things I did completely wrong. I’m fine with that. Looking back and not seeing a huge number of things I did wrong would mean that neither my writing nor my understanding had improved since 2009. Oops is the sound we make when we improve our beliefs and strategies; so to look back at a time and not see anything you did wrong means that you haven’t learned anything or changed your mind since then.

It was a mistake that I didn’t write my two years of blog posts with the intention of helping people do better in their everyday lives. I wrote it with the intention of helping people solve big, difficult, important problems, and I chose impressive-sounding, abstract problems as my examples.

In retrospect, this was the second-largest mistake in my approach. It ties in to the first-largest mistake in my writing, which was that I didn’t realize that the big problem in learning this valuable way of thinking was figuring out how to practice it, not knowing the theory. I didn’t realize that part was the priority; and regarding this I can only say “Oops” and “Duh.”

Yes, sometimes those big issues really are big and really are important; but that doesn’t change the basic truth that to master skills you need to practice them and it’s harder to practice on things that are further away. (Today the Center for Applied Rationality is working on repairing this huge mistake of mine in a more systematic fashion.)

A third huge mistake I made was to focus too much on rational belief, too little on rational action. The fourth-largest mistake I made was that I should have better organized the content I was presenting in the sequences. In particular, I should have created a wiki much earlier, and made it easier to read the posts in sequence.

That mistake at least is correctable. In the present work Rob Bensinger has reordered the posts and reorganized them as much as he can without trying to rewrite all the actual material (though he’s rewritten a bit of it).

My fifth huge mistake was that I—as I saw it—tried to speak plainly about the stupidity of what appeared to me to be stupid ideas. I did try to avoid the fallacy known as Bulverism, which is where you open your discussion by talking about how stupid people are for believing something; I would always discuss the issue first, and only afterwards say, “And so this is stupid.” But in 2009 it was an open question in my mind whether it might be important to have some people around who expressed contempt for homeopathy. I thought, and still do think, that there is an unfortunate problem wherein treating ideas courteously is processed by many people on some level as “Nothing bad will happen to me if I say I believe this; I won’t lose status if I say I believe in homeopathy,” and that derisive laughter by comedians can help people wake up from the dream.

Today I would write more courteously, I think. The discourtesy did serve a function, and I think there were people who were helped by reading it; but I now take more seriously the risk of building communities where the normal and expected reaction to low-status outsider views is open mockery and contempt.

Despite my mistake, I am happy to say that my readership has so far been amazingly good about not using my rhetoric as an excuse to bully or belittle others. (I want to single out Scott Alexander in particular here, who is a nicer person than I am and an increasingly amazing writer on these topics, and may deserve part of the credit for making the culture of Less Wrong a healthy one.)

To be able to look backwards and say that you’ve “failed” implies that you had goals. So what was it that I was trying to do?

There is a certain valuable way of thinking, which is not yet taught in schools, in this present day. This certain way of thinking is not taught systematically at all. It is just absorbed by people who grow up reading books like Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman or who have an unusually great teacher in high school.

Most famously, this certain way of thinking has to do with science, and with the experimental method. The part of science where you go out and look at the universe instead of just making things up. The part where you say “Oops” and give up on a bad theory when the experiments don’t support it.

But this certain way of thinking extends beyond that. It is deeper and more universal than a pair of goggles you put on when you enter a laboratory and take off when you leave. It applies to daily life, though this part is subtler and more difficult. But if you can’t say “Oops” and give up when it looks like something isn’t working, you have no choice but to keep shooting yourself in the foot. You have to keep reloading the shotgun and you have to keep pulling the trigger. You know people like this. And somewhere, someplace in your life you’d rather not think about, you are people like this. It would be nice if there was a certain way of thinking that could help us stop doing that.

In spite of how large my mistakes were, those two years of blog posting appeared to help a surprising number of people a surprising amount. It didn’t work reliably, but it worked sometimes.

In modern society so little is taught of the skills of rational belief and decision-making, so little of the mathematics and sciences underlying them . . . that it turns out that just reading through a massive brain-dump full of problems in philosophy and science can, yes, be surprisingly good for you. Walking through all of that, from a dozen different angles, can sometimes convey a glimpse of the central rhythm.

Because it is all, in the end, one thing. I talked about big important distant problems and neglected immediate life, but the laws governing them aren’t actually different. There are huge gaps in which parts I focused on, and I picked all the wrong examples; but it is all in the end one thing. I am proud to look back and say that, even after all the mistakes I made, and all the other times I said “Oops” . . .

Even five years later, it still appears to me that this is better than nothing.
