## 语义终止符

孩子问道：

- 问：这块石头从哪来的？
- 答：我从村子中央那块大巨石上敲下来的。
- 问：那块巨石从哪来的？
- 答：大概是从我们村子上方那座大山上滚下来的。
- 问：那座大山从哪来的？
- 答：和所有石头一样：它是原始巨人尤弥尔的骨头。
- 问：那原始巨人尤弥尔从哪来的？
- 答：来自巨大的深渊，Ginnungagap。
- 问：那巨大的深渊Ginnungagap从哪来的？
- 答：别再问下去了。

想想“第一因”的表面悖论。科学已经把事件追溯到大爆炸，但为什么会有大爆炸？说时间的零点从大爆炸开始——在通常的分钟和小时的流逝中，大爆炸之前什么都没有——这听起来没问题。但这么说其实是默认了我们的物理定律，而这些定律本身就高度结构化，需要解释。物理定律又从何而来？你可以说我们都是计算机模拟，但那这个模拟又运行在另一个世界的物理定律之上——那些物理定律又从哪来？

这时，有些人会说：“上帝！”

到底是什么让人——哪怕是极其虔诚的人——觉得这能帮助解答“第一因”的悖论？为什么你不会自然而然地追问：“那上帝从哪来的？”说“上帝是无因的”或“上帝自我创造”其实和“时间始于大爆炸”一样，并没有解决问题。我们只是把问题变成了“为什么整个元系统会存在”，或者“为什么有些事件可以无因而有，而其他事件不行”。

我在这里的目的不是讨论“第一因”的悖论本身，而是想问，为什么有人会觉得“上帝！”能解决这个悖论。说“上帝！”其实是一种部落认同的方式，这让人们有动力尽可能多地说出这个词——有些人甚至会用它来回答“为什么这场飓风袭击了新奥尔良？”这样的问题。即便如此，你还是希望人们能注意到，至少在“第一因”这个难题上，说“上帝！”并没有帮助。即使是真的，也没有让悖论变得不那么悖论。怎么会有人没注意到这一点呢？

Jonathan Wallace 提出，“上帝！”其实起到了“语义终止符”的作用——它不是一个命题断言，更像是一种认知上的红绿灯：此处禁止继续思考。<sup>1</sup> 说“上帝！”并不是解决了悖论，而是竖起了一块认知路标，阻止问题和答案链的继续延伸。

当然，你不会这么做，你是个正统的无神论者，对吧？但“上帝！”并不是唯一的语义终止符，只是最显眼的例子。

超人类技术——分子纳米技术、先进生物技术、基因技术、人工智能等等——带来了棘手的政策问题。比如，政府是否应该监管父母为孩子选择基因？父母能否故意选择精神分裂症基因？如果提升孩子智力的花费很高，政府是否应该帮助确保公平机会，防止出现认知精英阶层？你可以提出各种机构来应对这些政策问题——比如让私人慈善机构资助智力提升——但下一个显而易见的问题是：“这个机构真的有效吗？”如果我们依赖产品责任诉讼来防止公司制造有害纳米技术，这真的管用吗？

我认识一个人，他对所有这些问题的答案都是“自由民主！”就这样，这就是他的答案。如果你追问“自由民主在历史上处理过类似棘手问题的表现如何？”或者“如果自由民主做了蠢事怎么办？”那你就是独裁者、极端自由主义者，或者反正就是个很坏很坏的人。没人被允许质疑民主。

我曾把这种思维叫做“民主的神圣权利”。但更准确地说，“民主！”对他来说就是语义终止符。如果有人对他说“交给可口可乐公司来处理吧！”，他一定会追问：“为什么？可口可乐公司会怎么做？我们为什么要信任他们？他们以前处理过同样棘手的问题吗？”

再比如，有人说：“墨西哥裔美国人正在密谋移除地球大气中的所有氧气。”你大概会问：“他们为什么要这么做？墨西哥裔美国人自己也要呼吸吧？他们真的能形成统一的阴谋吗？”但如果有人说“企业正在密谋移除地球氧气”，你却不追问这些显而易见的问题，那么“企业！”对你来说就成了语义终止符。

这里要注意，不要把“哦，这只是个终止符！”当作你不喜欢的事物的通用反驳。没有哪个词本身就是终止符；关键在于某个词对某个人是否起到了这种作用。对某事有强烈情感，并不意味着它就是终止符。我并不喜欢恐怖分子，也不害怕私有财产，但这并不意味着“恐怖分子！”或“资本主义！”对我来说就是认知红灯。（“智能”这个词曾经对我有这种效果，但现在没有了。）语义终止符的本质，是你没有继续思考那些显而易见的下一个问题。

## Semantic Stopsigns

And the child asked:

- Q: Where did this rock come from?
- A: I chipped it off the big boulder, at the center of the village.
- Q: Where did the boulder come from?
- A: It probably rolled off the huge mountain that towers over our village.
- Q: Where did the mountain come from?
- A: The same place as all stone: it is the bones of Ymir, the primordial giant.
- Q: Where did the primordial giant, Ymir, come from?
- A: From the great abyss, Ginnungagap.
- Q: Where did the great abyss, Ginnungagap, come from?
- A: Never ask that question.

Consider the seeming paradox of the First Cause. Science has traced events back to the Big Bang, but why did the Big Bang happen? It’s all well and good to say that the zero of time begins at the Big Bang—that there is nothing before the Big Bang in the ordinary flow of minutes and hours. But saying this presumes our physical law, which itself appears highly structured; it calls out for explanation. Where did the physical laws come from? You could say that we’re all a computer simulation, but then the computer simulation is running on some other world’s laws of physics—where did those laws of physics come from?

At this point, some people say, “God!”

What could possibly make anyone, even a highly religious person, think this even helped answer the paradox of the First Cause? Why wouldn’t you automatically ask, “Where did God come from?” Saying “God is uncaused” or “God created Himself” leaves us in exactly the same position as “Time began with the Big Bang.” We just ask why the whole metasystem exists in the first place, or why some events but not others are allowed to be uncaused.

My purpose here is not to discuss the seeming paradox of the First Cause, but to ask why anyone would think “God!” could resolve the paradox. Saying “God!” is a way of belonging to a tribe, which gives people a motive to say it as often as possible—some people even say it for questions like “Why did this hurricane strike New Orleans?” Even so, you’d hope people would notice that on the particular puzzle of the First Cause, saying “God!” doesn’t help. It doesn’t make the paradox seem any less paradoxical even if true. How could anyone not notice this?

Jonathan Wallace suggested that “God!” functions as a semantic stopsign—that it isn’t a propositional assertion, so much as a cognitive traffic signal: do not think past this point.<sup>1</sup> Saying “God!” doesn’t so much resolve the paradox, as put up a cognitive traffic signal to halt the obvious continuation of the question-and-answer chain.

Of course you’d never do that, being a good and proper atheist, right? But “God!” isn’t the only semantic stopsign, just the obvious first example.

The transhuman technologies—molecular nanotechnology, advanced biotech, genetech, artificial intelligence, et cetera—pose tough policy questions. What kind of role, if any, should a government take in supervising a parent’s choice of genes for their child? Could parents deliberately choose genes for schizophrenia? If enhancing a child’s intelligence is expensive, should governments help ensure access, to prevent the emergence of a cognitive elite? You can propose various institutions to answer these policy questions—for example, that private charities should provide financial aid for intelligence enhancement—but the obvious next question is, “Will this institution be effective?” If we rely on product liability lawsuits to prevent corporations from building harmful nanotech, will that really work?

I know someone whose answer to every one of these questions is “Liberal democracy!” That’s it. That’s his answer. If you ask the obvious question of “How well have liberal democracies performed, historically, on problems this tricky?” or “What if liberal democracy does something stupid?” then you’re an autocrat, or libertopian, or otherwise a very very bad person. No one is allowed to question democracy.

I once called this kind of thinking “the divine right of democracy.” But it is more precise to say that “Democracy!” functioned for him as a semantic stopsign. If anyone had said to him “Turn it over to the CocaCola corporation!” he would have asked the obvious next questions: “Why? What will the Coca-Cola corporation do about it? Why should we trust them? Have they done well in the past on equally tricky problems?”

Or suppose that someone says, “Mexican-Americans are plotting to remove all the oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere.” You’d probably ask, “Why would they do that? Don’t Mexican-Americans have to breathe too? Do Mexican-Americans even function as a unified conspiracy?” If you don’t ask these obvious next questions when someone says, “Corporations are plotting to remove Earth’s oxygen,” then “Corporations!” functions for you as a semantic stopsign.

Be careful here not to create a new generic counterargument against things you don’t like—“Oh, it’s just a stopsign!” No word is a stopsign of itself; the question is whether a word has that effect on a particular person. Having strong emotions about something doesn’t qualify it as a stopsign. I’m not exactly fond of terrorists or fearful of private property; that doesn’t mean “Terrorists!” or “Capitalism!” are cognitive traffic signals unto me. (The word “intelligence” did once have that effect on me, though no longer.) What distinguishes a semantic stopsign is failure to consider the obvious next question.
