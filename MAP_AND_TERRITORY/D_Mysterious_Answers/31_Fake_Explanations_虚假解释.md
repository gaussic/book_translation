## 虚假解释

从前，有一位教授教物理学生。一天，这位教授把学生们叫进教室，给他们看了一块宽大的方形金属板，旁边放着一个热暖气片。学生们每个人都把手放在金属板上，发现靠近暖气片的一侧反而是凉的，远离暖气片的一侧却是热的。教授问：“你们觉得这是为什么？”有的学生猜是空气对流，有的猜是金属板里有奇怪的金属。他们想出了许多创意十足的解释，但没有一个人愿意说“我不知道”或“这看起来不可能”。

而答案其实是，在学生们进教室之前，教授把金属板转了个方向。<sup>1</sup>

想想那个慌乱地结结巴巴说“呃，也许是因为热传导之类的？”的学生。我想问：这个答案算是一个真正的信念吗？这些话说出来很容易——可以大声而坚定地说出来。但这些话真的能控制你的预期吗？

请思考一下那个无辜的小短语，“因为”，它出现在“热传导”之前。再想想我们还能在后面加些什么。比如我们可以说，“因为燃素”，或者“因为魔法”。

“魔法！”你会喊道，“那不是科学解释！”确实，“因为热传导”和“因为魔法”这两句话很容易被归为不同的文学类型。“热传导”是星际迷航里的斯波克会说的话，而“魔法”则是《吸血鬼猎人巴菲》里的贾尔斯会说的。

然而，作为贝叶斯主义者，我们并不在意文学类型。对我们来说，一个模型的实质在于它对预期的约束力。如果你说“热传导”，那会让你预期什么样的体验？在正常情况下，这会让你预期，把手放在靠近暖气片的一侧时，那一侧会比另一侧更热。如果“因为热传导”同样可以解释靠近暖气片的一侧更凉，那么它几乎可以解释任何结果。

正如我们现在都应该知道的（我希望如此），如果你能同样好地解释任何结果，那你就一无所知。像这样用“因为热传导”，其实就是伪装成科学的最大熵假说。它在预期上等同于说“魔法”。它听起来像个解释，但其实不是。

假如我们不是猜测，而是在不同位置、不同时间测量金属板的温度。看到一块金属板放在暖气片旁，我们通常会预期各点的温度满足扩散方程的平衡解，边界条件由环境决定。你可能不知道第一个测量点的确切温度，但测量了前几个点后——我不是物理学家，不知道需要多少点——你就能很好地猜出剩下的温度。

一个真正掌握用数字约束物理现象预期艺术的大师——也就是“物理学家”——会做一些测量，然后说：“这块金属板在两分半钟前还和环境处于平衡状态，后来被转了个方向，现在正在重新接近平衡。”

学生们更深层的错误，不仅仅是他们没有约束自己的预期。他们更深的错误在于，他们以为自己在做物理。他们说出了“因为”这个短语，后面跟着斯波克会说的那种词，就以为自己进入了科学的殿堂。

其实不然。他们只是把自己的“魔法”从一种文学类型换成了另一种。

## Fake Explanations

Once upon a time, there was an instructor who taught physics students. One day the instructor called them into the classroom and showed them a wide, square plate of metal, next to a hot radiator. The students each put their hand on the plate and found the side next to the radiator cool, and the distant side warm. And the instructor said, Why do you think this happens? Some students guessed convection of air currents, and others guessed strange metals in the plate. They devised many creative explanations, none stooping so low as to say “I don’t know” or “This seems impossible.”

And the answer was that before the students entered the room, the instructor turned the plate around.<sup>1</sup>

Consider the student who frantically stammers, “Eh, maybe because of the heat conduction and so?” I ask: Is this answer a proper belief? The words are easily enough professed—said in a loud, emphatic voice. But do the words actually control anticipation?

Ponder that innocent little phrase, “because of,” which comes before “heat conduction.” Ponder some of the other things we could put after it. We could say, for example, “Because of phlogiston,” or “Because of magic.”

“Magic!” you cry. “That’s not a scientific explanation!” Indeed, the phrases “because of heat conduction” and “because of magic” are readily recognized as belonging to different literary genres. “Heat conduction” is something that Spock might say on Star Trek, whereas “magic” would be said by Giles in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

However, as Bayesians, we take no notice of literary genres. For us, the substance of a model is the control it exerts on anticipation. If you say “heat conduction,” what experience does that lead you to anticipate? Under normal circumstances, it leads you to anticipate that, if you put your hand on the side of the plate near the radiator, that side will feel warmer than the opposite side. If “because of heat conduction” can also explain the radiator-adjacent side feeling cooler, then it can explain pretty much anything.

And as we all know by this point (I do hope), if you are equally good at explaining any outcome, you have zero knowledge. “Because of heat conduction,” used in such fashion, is a disguised hypothesis of maximum entropy. It is anticipation-isomorphic to saying “magic.” It feels like an explanation, but it’s not.

Suppose that instead of guessing, we measured the heat of the metal plate at various points and various times. Seeing a metal plate next to the radiator, we would ordinarily expect the point temperatures to satisfy an equilibrium of the diffusion equation with respect to the boundary conditions imposed by the environment. You might not know the exact temperature of the first point measured, but after measuring the first points—I’m not physicist enough to know how many would be required—you could take an excellent guess at the rest.

A true master of the art of using numbers to constrain the anticipation of material phenomena—a “physicist”—would take some measurements and say, “This plate was in equilibrium with the environment two and a half minutes ago, turned around, and is now approaching equilibrium again.”

The deeper error of the students is not simply that they failed to constrain anticipation. Their deeper error is that they thought they were doing physics. They said the phrase “because of,” followed by the sort of words Spock might say on Star Trek, and thought they thereby entered the magisterium of science.

Not so. They simply moved their magic from one literary genre to another.
