## 可得性

可得性启发是指：我们根据某一事件的例子在脑海中浮现的容易程度，来判断该事件发生的频率或概率。

Lichtenstein、Slovic、Fischhoff、Layman 和 Combs 在1978年进行了一项著名的研究《致命事件的判断频率》，研究人们在量化风险严重性或判断两种危险哪种更常见时的错误。受试者认为事故导致的死亡人数与疾病差不多，认为他杀比自杀更常见。实际上，疾病导致的死亡人数大约是事故的16倍，而自杀的发生率是他杀的两倍。

一个显而易见的假设是：谋杀案比自杀案更容易被人谈论——因此，人们更容易回忆起听说过的谋杀案，而不是自杀案。事故比疾病更具戏剧性——也许这让人们更容易记住或回忆起事故。1979年，Combs 和 Slovic 的后续研究显示，这种概率判断的偏差与两家报纸报道频率的偏差高度相关（相关系数分别为0.85和0.89）。这并不能区分是因为谋杀案被报道得更多所以更容易被记住，还是因为谋杀案本身更生动所以媒体更愿意报道（因此也更容易被记住）。但无论哪种情况，可得性偏差都在起作用。

选择性报道是可得性偏差的一个主要来源。在祖先时代，你所知道的大部分事情都是自己亲身经历的，或者直接听见部落成员讲述他们亲眼所见的事情。你与事件之间通常最多只有一层选择性报道。而在今天的互联网时代，你看到的报道可能已经经过六个博主的转发——六道过滤。与我们的祖先相比，我们生活在一个更大的世界，发生的事情更多，但真正传递到我们这里的却更少——这种更强的筛选效应会造成更大的可得性偏差。

在现实生活中，你几乎不可能遇到比尔·盖茨。但由于媒体的选择性报道，你可能会忍不住把自己的人生成就和他比较——并因此在幸福感上受损。比尔·盖茨在世界上的客观比例是0.00000000015，但你听到他的消息却远比这个频率高。反过来，地球上有19%的人每天生活费不足1美元，但你读到的博客中，恐怕没有五分之一是他们写的。使用可得性启发还会导致荒谬性偏差：从未发生过的事件不会被回忆起，因此被认为概率为零。当最近没有发生洪水时（即使概率其实可以合理计算），人们也不愿意购买洪水保险，即使保险价格远低于精算公平价值且有大量补贴。Kunreuther 等人认为，对洪水威胁的反应不足，可能源于“人们无法想象从未发生过的洪水……住在洪泛区的人似乎完全被自己的经验所囚禁……最近经历过的洪水似乎为管理者设定了他们认为需要关注的损失上限。”<sup>1</sup>

Burton 等人报告说，当修建水坝和堤防后，洪水发生的频率降低了，因此表面上带来了虚假的安全感，导致防范措施减少。<sup>2</sup> 虽然修建水坝减少了洪水的发生频率，但每次洪水造成的损失却大大增加，导致年均损失反而上升。

明智的人会从对小风险的记忆推断出大风险的可能性。但实际上，过去对小风险的经验似乎设定了风险的感知上限。一个对小风险防护得很好的社会，对重大风险却无所作为——一旦常规的小洪水被消除，人们就会在洪泛区建房。一个经常遭遇小风险的社会，则把这些小风险当作风险规模的上限，只防范常规的小洪水，而忽视偶发的大洪水。

记忆并不总是判断过去概率的好向导，更不用说未来了。

## Availability

The availability heuristic is judging the frequency or probability of an event by the ease with which examples of the event come to mind.

A famous 1978 study by Lichtenstein, Slovic, Fischhoff, Layman, and Combs, “Judged Frequency of Lethal Events,” studied errors in quantifying the severity of risks, or judging which of two dangers occurred more frequently. Subjects thought that accidents caused about as many deaths as disease; thought that homicide was a more frequent cause of death than suicide. Actually, diseases cause about sixteen times as many deaths as accidents, and suicide is twice as frequent as homicide.

An obvious hypothesis to account for these skewed beliefs is that murders are more likely to be talked about than suicides—thus, someone is more likely to recall hearing about a murder than hearing about a suicide. Accidents are more dramatic than diseases—perhaps this makes people more likely to remember, or more likely to recall, an accident. In 1979, a followup study by Combs and Slovic showed that the skewed probability judgments correlated strongly (0.85 and 0.89) with skewed reporting frequencies in two newspapers. This doesn’t disentangle whether murders are more available to memory because they are more reported-on, or whether newspapers report more on murders because murders are more vivid (hence also more remembered). But either way, an availability bias is at work.

Selective reporting is one major source of availability biases. In the ancestral environment, much of what you knew, you experienced yourself; or you heard it directly from a fellow tribe-member who had seen it. There was usually at most one layer of selective reporting between you, and the event itself. With today’s Internet, you may see reports that have passed through the hands of six bloggers on the way to you—six successive filters. Compared to our ancestors, we live in a larger world, in which far more happens, and far less of it reaches us—a much stronger selection effect, which can create much larger availability biases.

In real life, you’re unlikely to ever meet Bill Gates. But thanks to selective reporting by the media, you may be tempted to compare your life success to his—and suffer hedonic penalties accordingly. The objective frequency of Bill Gates is 0.00000000015, but you hear about him much more often. Conversely, 19% of the planet lives on less than $1/day, and I doubt that one fifth of the blog posts you read are written by them. Using availability seems to give rise to an absurdity bias; events that have never happened are not recalled, and hence deemed to have probability zero. When no flooding has recently occurred (and yet the probabilities are still fairly calculable), people refuse to buy flood insurance even when it is heavily subsidized and priced far below an actuarially fair value. Kunreuther et al. suggest underreaction to threats of flooding may arise from “the inability of individuals to conceptualize floods that have never occurred . . . Men on flood plains appear to be very much prisoners of their experience . . . Recently experienced floods appear to set an upward bound to the size of loss with which managers believe they ought to be concerned.”<sup>1</sup>

Burton et al. report that when dams and levees are built, they reduce the frequency of floods, and thus apparently create a false sense of security, leading to reduced precautions.<sup>2</sup> While building dams decreases the frequency of floods, damage per flood is afterward so much greater that average yearly damage increases.

The wise would extrapolate from a memory of small hazards to the possibility of large hazards. Instead, past experience of small hazards seems to set a perceived upper bound on risk. A society well-protected against minor hazards takes no action against major risks, building on flood plains once the regular minor floods are eliminated. A society subject to regular minor hazards treats those minor hazards as an upper bound on the size of the risks, guarding against regular minor floods but not occasional major floods.

Memory is not always a good guide to probabilities in the past, let alone in the future.
