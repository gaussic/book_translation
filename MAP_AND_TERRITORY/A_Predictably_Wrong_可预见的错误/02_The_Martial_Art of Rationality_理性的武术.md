## 理性的武术

我常用“理性是心灵的武术”这个比喻。你不需要强壮的肌肉才能学习武术——虽然更有运动天赋的人可能更容易学会武术，但这也许更多是因为他们更享受这个过程。如果你有一只手，肌腱和肌肉都在合适的位置，你就能学会握拳。

同样地，如果你有一颗大脑，皮层和皮下结构都在合适的位置，你也许就能学会正确地使用它。如果你学得快，你可能进步更快——但理性的艺术并不在于此；它在于训练我们每个人都共有的大脑机制。而当人类大脑有一些系统性错误倾向——比如对范围的不敏感——理性就是要修正这些错误，或者找到替代方案。

遗憾的是，我们的心灵对我们的意志响应远不如我们的双手。我们控制肌肉的能力在进化上非常古老；而我们对自身推理过程进行推理的能力则是更近才出现的创新。因此，肌肉比大脑更容易使用，这并不奇怪。但仅仅因为大脑训练更难，就忽视它的训练，是不明智的。人类之所以能在地球上崛起，并不是因为有更大的肌肉。

如果你住在城市里，可能不用走多远就能找到一家武馆。可为什么没有教授理性的“道场”呢？

也许原因之一，是理性技能更难验证。比如在跆拳道中晋级，你可能需要劈断一定宽度的木板。如果你成功了，所有观众都能看到并为你鼓掌。如果你失败了，老师可以观察你如何握拳，检查你是否做对了。如果没有，老师会伸出手，正确地握拳，让你观察学习。

在武术学校里，肌肉的技巧经过了几代人的打磨和发展。而理性的技巧，即使是最愿意学习的学生，也很难传授。直到最近几十年，人类才获得了大量关于人类理性的全新知识。最显著的例子是实验心理学中的启发式与偏差项目。还有概率论和统计学的贝叶斯系统化；进化心理学；社会心理学。对人类心理的实证实验研究，以及用理论概率论来解释实验结果；还有用进化理论来解释结论。这些领域为我们提供了新的聚焦镜头，让我们能更清晰地观察自己心灵的肌肉、思想的手指如何运动。我们有了共同的词汇来描述问题和解决方案。人类也许终于准备好去综合心灵的武术：去打磨、分享、系统化并传承个人理性的技巧。

我对理性的理解，是在与通用人工智能挑战的搏斗中获得的（要真正取得成功，意味着你必须掌握足够的理性，甚至能用牙签和橡皮筋造出一个完整可用的理性主义者）。在很多方面，人工智能问题比个人理性的艺术要求高得多，但在某些方面其实更容易。在心灵的武术中，我们需要获得一种实时的程序性技能，能够在一个庞大、既有的思维机器上，在正确的时刻拉动正确的杠杆，而这台机器的内部结构并不允许终端用户修改。其中有些机制是为进化选择压力优化的，这些压力与我们宣称的目标恰恰相反。我们可以有意识地决定只追求真理；但我们的大脑却有硬件级的支持来为谬误辩护。我们可以试图补偿我们认为的这些机制缺陷；但我们无法真正重接神经回路。就像武术家也不能给自己的骨头镀上一层钛——至少现在还不行。

试图用理性科学来综合个人理性的艺术，可能会显得笨拙：就像你想用物理学、博弈论和人体解剖学的抽象理论去发明一种武术。

但人类并非对自省一无所知。我们天生就有内省的本能。内心之眼并非全然失明，尽管它看到的东西模糊且有系统性扭曲。因此，我们需要把科学应用于直觉，用抽象知识来修正我们的心理动作，增强我们的元认知技能。

我们不是在写一个让木偶表演武术套路的计算机程序；我们要操控的是自己的心灵四肢。因此，我们必须把理论与实践结合起来。我们必须亲自体会科学对我们自身、对我们日常内心生活意味着什么。

## The Martial Art of Rationality

I often use the metaphor that rationality is the martial art of mind. You don’t need huge, bulging muscles to learn martial arts—there’s a tendency toward more athletic people being more likely to learn martial arts, but that may be a matter of enjoyment as much as anything else. If you have a hand, with tendons and muscles in the appropriate places, then you can learn to make a fist.

Similarly, if you have a brain, with cortical and subcortical areas in the appropriate places, you might be able to learn to use it properly. If you’re a fast learner, you might learn faster—but the art of rationality isn’t about that; it’s about training brain machinery we all have in common. And where there are systematic errors human brains tend to make—like an insensitivity to scope—rationality is about fixing those mistakes, or finding work-arounds.

Alas, our minds respond less readily to our will than our hands. Our ability to control our muscles is evolutionarily ancient; our ability to reason about our own reasoning processes is a much more recent innovation. We shouldn’t be surprised, then, that muscles are easier to use than brains. But it is not wise to neglect the latter training because it is more difficult. It is not by bigger muscles that the human species rose to prominence upon
Earth.

If you live in an urban area, you probably don’t need to walk very far to find a martial arts dojo. Why aren’t there dojos that teach rationality?

One reason, perhaps, is that it’s harder to verify skill. To rise a level in Tae Kwon Do, you might need to break a board of a certain width. If you succeed, all the onlookers can see and applaud. If you fail, your teacher can watch how you shape a fist, and check if you shape it correctly. If not, the teacher holds out a hand and makes a fist correctly, so that you can observe how to do so.

Within martial arts schools, techniques of muscle have been refined and elaborated over generations. Techniques of rationality are harder to pass on, even to the most willing student. Very recently—in just the last few decades—the human species has acquired a great deal of new knowledge about human rationality. The most salient example would be the heuristics and biases program in experimental psychology. There is also the Bayesian systematization of probability theory and statistics; evolutionary psychology; social psychology. Experimental investigations of empirical human psychology; and theoretical probability theory to interpret what our experiments tell us; and evolutionary theory to explain the conclusions. These fields give us new focusing lenses through which to view the landscape of our own minds. With their aid, we may be able to see more clearly the muscles of our brains, the fingers of thought as they move. We have a shared voc abulary in which to describe problems and solutions. Humanity may finally be ready to synthesize the martial art of mind: to refine, share, systematize, and pass on techniques of personal rationality.

Such understanding as I have of rationality, I acquired in the course of wrestling with the challenge of artificial general intelligence (an endeavor which, to actually succeed, would require sufficient mastery of rationality to build a complete working rationalist out of toothpicks and rubber bands). In most ways the AI problem is enormously more demanding than the personal art of rationality, but in some ways it is actually easier. In the martial art of mind, we need to acquire the realtime procedural skill of pulling the right levers at the right time on a large, pre-existing thinking machine whose innards are not end-user-modifiable. Some of the machinery is optimized for evolutionary selection pressures that run directly counter to our declared goals in using it. Deliberately we decide that we want to seek only the truth; but our brains have hardwired support for rationalizing falsehoods. We can try to compensate for what we choose to regard as flaws of the machinery; but we can’t actually rewire the neural circuitry. Nor may martial artists plate titanium over their bones—not today, at any rate.

Trying to synthesize a personal art of rationality, using the science of rationality, may prove awkward: One imagines trying to invent a martial art using an abstract theory of physics, game theory, and human anatomy.

But humans aren’t reflectively blind. We do have a native instinct for introspection. The inner eye isn’t sightless, though it sees blurrily, with systematic distortions. We need, then, to apply the science to our intuitions, to use the abstract knowledge to correct our mental movements and augment our metacognitive skills.

We aren’t writing a computer program to make a string puppet execute martial arts forms; it is our own mental limbs that we must move. Therefore we must connect theory to practice. We must come to see what the science means, for ourselves, for our daily inner life.
