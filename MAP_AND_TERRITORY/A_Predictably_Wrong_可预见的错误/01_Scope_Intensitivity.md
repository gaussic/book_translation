## 范围不敏感

很久以前，研究者让三组受试者分别回答：他们愿意为拯救2,000只、20,000只或200,000只因落入未覆盖油池而溺亡的候鸟支付多少钱。三组的答案分别是80美元、78美元和88美元。<sup>1</sup> 这就是“范围不敏感”或“范围忽视”：被拯救鸟类的数量——即利他行为的范围——对人们愿意支付的金额几乎没有影响。

类似的实验还显示，多伦多居民为清理安大略省所有污染湖泊所愿支付的金额，和为清理安大略省某一地区污染湖泊的金额相差无几；美国西部四个州的居民为保护这四州全部57个荒野区所愿支付的金额，仅比保护单一区域多28%。<sup>2</sup> 人们脑海中浮现的，是“一只筋疲力尽、羽毛沾满黑油、无法逃脱的鸟”。<sup>3</sup> 这个画面，或说原型，激发了一定程度的情感反应，这种情感反应主要决定了人们愿意支付的金额——而这个画面在所有情境下都是一样的。至于范围，则被抛诸脑后——没有人能同时想象出2,000只鸟，更别说20万只了。通常的发现是，范围呈指数级增加时，人们愿意支付的金额只呈线性增加——这也许对应着我们眼睛扫过那些零所需的线性时间；而这点微弱的情感影响，是与原型情感相加，而不是相乘。这一假说被称为“原型估值”。

另一种假说是“购买道德满足感”。人们花足够的钱来让自己感到温暖，觉得自己尽了责任。获得这种温暖感所需的花费取决于个人性格和经济状况，但显然与鸟的数量无关。

即使涉及人命，我们对范围也同样不敏感：将氯化饮用水导致的年死亡风险从每千人0.004人提高到2.43人——相差600倍——人们愿意支付的金额也只从3.78美元增加到15.23美元。<sup>4</sup> Baron 和 Greene 发现，拯救人数相差10倍，对人们的支付意愿没有影响。<sup>5</sup>

一篇题为《对生命价值的不敏感：心理物理麻木的研究》的论文收集了证据，表明我们对死亡人数的感知遵循韦伯定律——即遵循对数刻度，“刚刚可察觉的差异”是整体的一个恒定比例。一个旨在拯救卢旺达难民生命的健康项目，如果承诺在1.1万人的营地中拯救4,500人，获得的支持远高于在25万人的营地中拯救同样人数。如果某种疾病被描述为每年致死29万人，那么要获得资助，潜在的治疗方案必须承诺拯救更多生命；而如果该病每年致死16万人或1.5万人，则所需承诺的拯救人数就少得多。<sup>6</sup>

道理是：如果你想成为一名有效的利他主义者，你必须用大脑中能处理那些枯燥数字的部分来思考，而不仅仅是被那只挣扎在油污中的可怜小鸟所打动的部分。

## Scope Insensitivity

Once upon a time, three groups of subjects were asked how much they would pay to save 2,000 / 20,000 / 200,000 migrating birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The groups respectively answered \$80, \$78, and \$88.<sup>1</sup> This is scope insensitivity or scope neglect: the number of birds saved—the scope of the altruistic action—had little effect on willingness to pay.

Similar experiments showed that Toronto residents would pay little more to clean up all polluted lakes in Ontario than polluted lakes in a particular region of Ontario, or that residents of four western US states would pay only 28% more to protect all 57 wilderness areas in those states than to protect a single area.<sup>2</sup> People visualize “a single exhausted bird, its feathers soaked in black oil, unable to escape.”<sup>3</sup> This image, or prototype, calls forth some level of emotional arousal that is primarily responsible for willingness-to-pay—and the image is the same in all cases. As for scope, it gets tossed out the window—no human can visualize 2,000 birds at once, let alone 200,000. The usual finding is that exponential increases in scope create linear increases in willingness-to-pay—perhaps corresponding to the linear time for our eyes to glaze over the zeroes; this small amount of affect is added, not multiplied, with the prototype affect. This hypothesis is known as “valuation by prototype.”

An alternative hypothesis is “purchase of moral satisfaction.” People spend enough money to create a warm glow in themselves, a sense of having done their duty. The level of spending needed to purchase a warm glow depends on personality and financial situation, but it certainly has nothing to do with the number of birds.

We are insensitive to scope even when human lives are at stake: Increasing the alleged risk of chlorinated drinking water from 0.004 to 2.43 annual deaths per 1,000—a factor of 600—increased willingness-to-pay from \$3.78 to \$15.23.<sup>4</sup> Baron and Greene found no effect from varying lives saved by a factor of 10.<sup>5</sup>

A paper entitled “Insensitivity to the value of human life: A study of psychophysical numbing” collected evidence that our perception of human deaths follows Weber’s Law—obeys a logarithmic scale where the “just noticeable difference” is a constant fraction of the whole. A proposed health program to save the lives of Rwandan refugees garnered far higher support when it promised to save 4,500 lives in a camp of 11,000 refugees, rather than 4,500 in a camp of 250,000. A potential disease cure had to promise to save far more lives in order to be judged worthy of funding, if the disease was originally stated to have killed 290,000 rather than 160,000 or 15,000 people per year.<sup>6</sup>

The moral: If you want to be an effective altruist, you have to think it through with the part of your brain that processes those unexciting inky zeroes on paper, not just the part that gets real worked up about that poor struggling oil-soaked bird.
