## 为什么要追求真理？

工具理性的目标本身就很明确。但有些评论者会疑惑，理性主义者为什么如此在意真理。这个问题有多种不同的答案，取决于你问的是谁；而这些不同的答案也会以不同的方式影响我们对真理的追寻。

你也许认为，追求真理本身就是高尚、重要且有价值的。在这种情况下，你的优先级会由你心中哪些真理最重要、或者在何时追求真理最具美德的理想所决定。

这种动机往往带有道德色彩。如果你认为揭开帷幕后面的真相是你的责任，你就更可能认为别人也应该去看真相，或者在他们故意闭上眼睛时加以指责。

我对把道德作为理性动机持怀疑态度，并不是因为我否定道德理想，而是因为这会带来某些麻烦。人们很容易把一些糟糕的思维方式当作学来的道德义务，从而在理性的舞蹈中踏错步伐。

想想斯波克，这个理性的天真原型。斯波克总是表现得“冷静”，即使在极不合适的时候也是如此。他经常给出许多小数位的概率，但这些概率其实极不准确。<sup>1</sup> 然而，许多人正是以这种形象来理解“理性”的责任——难怪他们无法全心全意地接受理性。

把理性变成一种道德义务，就等于赋予它任意部落习俗那种可怕的自由度。人们得出了错误的答案，却愤怒地辩解自己行为得体，而不是从错误中学习。

还有哪些其他动机呢？

比如，你可能想实现某个现实世界的具体目标，比如造一架飞机，因此你需要了解空气动力学的某些具体真理。或者更日常一点，你想喝巧克力牛奶，因此你想知道附近的杂货店有没有卖，这样你才能决定要不要去那家店。

如果你追求真理的原因是这个，那么你对问题的优先级排序就会反映出这些信息的期望效用——即不同答案对你选择的影响有多大，你的选择有多重要，以及你有多大可能找到一个能改变你默认选择的答案。

仅仅因为工具价值而追求真理，可能听起来不够纯粹——难道我们不该为了真理本身而追求真理吗？——但这种探索极为重要，因为它为验证提供了外部标准：如果你的飞机坠毁了，或者你到了商店却发现没有巧克力牛奶，这就暗示你哪里做错了。你会得到反馈，知道哪些思维方式有效，哪些无效。

还有一种可能：你在乎真理，仅仅因为你真的很好奇。

以好奇心为理由去追求真理，有一种特殊而令人钦佩的纯粹性。如果你的动机是好奇心，你会根据问题本身能否激发你的审美感来决定优先级。一个更难、更有失败可能性的挑战，可能仅仅因为更有趣而值得你投入更多努力。

好奇心和道德都能赋予真理内在价值。但对帷幕后面感到好奇，和认为自己有道德责任去看那里，是完全不同的心态。如果你是出于好奇，你的优先级会由你觉得最有趣的真理决定，而不是最重要或最有用的真理。

尽管纯粹的好奇心很美好，但一旦谜题的吸引力消失，它未必会花太多时间去验证答案。好奇心作为一种人类情感，远早于古希腊时代就已存在。但真正让人类坚定走上科学之路的，是我们发现某些思维方式能揭示出让我们操控世界的信念——即把真理当作工具。就纯粹好奇心而言，围着篝火讲神话和英雄故事同样能满足这种欲望，没人觉得这有什么问题。

与此同时，如果我们想提升理性技能，超越狩猎采集者的表现标准，我们就需要有意识地建立关于如何思考的信念——这些信念看起来就像理性主义者的“规范”。当我们为自己编写新的心理程序时，它们一开始是明确的指令，只有慢慢地（如果有的话）才会被训练进我们核心动机和习惯背后的神经回路。

好奇心、实用主义和准道德的自我要求，都是理性主义事业的关键。但如果你问我哪一个最根本，我会说：“好奇心。”我有我的原则，也有我的计划，这些原则和计划可能会告诉我要去揭开帷幕。但同时，我也真的很想知道。究竟会看到什么？世界给了我一个谜题，而答案似乎近在咫尺。

## Why Truth?

The goal of instrumental rationality mostly speaks for itself. Some commenters have wondered, on the other hand, why rationalists care about truth. Which invites a few different answers, depending on who you ask; and these different answers have differing characters, which can shape the search for truth in different ways.

You might hold the view that pursuing truth is inherently noble, important, and worthwhile. In which case your priorities will be determined by your ideals about which truths are most important, or about when truthseeking is most virtuous.

This motivation tends to have a moral character to it. If you think it your duty to look behind the curtain, you are a lot more likely to believe that someone else should look behind the curtain too, or castigate them if they deliberately close their eyes.

I tend to be suspicious of morality as a motivation for rationality, not because I reject the moral ideal, but because it invites certain kinds of trouble. It is too easy to acquire, as learned moral duties, modes of thinking that are dreadful missteps in the dance.

Consider Spock, the naive archetype of rationality. Spock’s affect is always set to “calm,” even when wildly inappropriate. He often gives many significant digits for probabilities that are grossly uncalibrated.<sup>1</sup> Yet this popular image is how many people conceive of the duty to be “rational”—small wonder that they do not embrace it wholeheartedly.

To make rationality into a moral duty is to give it all the dreadful degrees of freedom of an arbitrary tribal custom. People arrive at the wrong answer, and then indignantly protest that they acted with propriety, rather than learning from their mistake.

What other motives are there?

Well, you might want to accomplish some specific real-world goal, like building an airplane, and therefore you need to know some specific truth about aerodynamics. Or more mundanely, you want chocolate milk, and therefore you want to know whether the local grocery has chocolate milk, so you can choose whether to walk there or somewhere else.

If this is the reason you want truth, then the priority you assign to your questions will reflect the expected utility of their information—how much the possible answers influence your choices, how much your choices matter, and how much you expect to find an answer that changes your choice from its default.

To seek truth merely for its instrumental value may seem impure— should we not desire the truth for its own sake?—but such investigations are extremely important because they create an outside criterion of verification: if your airplane drops out of the sky, or if you get to the store and find no chocolate milk, it’s a hint that you did something wrong. You get back feedback on which modes of thinking work, and which don’t.

Another possibility: you might care about what’s true because, damn it, you’re curious.

As a reason to seek truth, curiosity has a special and admirable purity. If your motive is curiosity, you will assign priority to questions according to how the questions, themselves, tickle your aesthetic sense. A trickier challenge, with a greater probability of failure, may be worth more effort than a simpler one, just because it’s more fun.

Curiosity and morality can both attach an intrinsic value to truth. Yet being curious about what’s behind the curtain is a very different state of mind from believing that you have a moral duty to look there. If you’re curious, your priorities will be determined by which truths you find most intriguing, not most important or most useful.

Although pure curiosity is a wonderful thing, it may not linger too long on verifying its answers, once the attractive mystery is gone. Curiosity, as a human emotion, has been around since long before the ancient Greeks. But what set humanity firmly on the path of Science was noticing that certain modes of thinking uncovered beliefs that let us manipulate the world—truth as an instrument. As far as sheer curiosity goes, spinning campfire tales of gods and heroes satisfied that desire just as well, and no one realized that anything was wrong with that.

At the same time, if we’re going to improve our skills of rationality, go beyond the standards of performance set by hunter-gatherers, we’ll need deliberate beliefs about how to think—things that look like norms of rationalist “propriety.” When we write new mental programs for ourselves, they start out as explicit injunctions, and are only slowly (if ever) trained into the neural circuitry that underlies our core motivations and habits.

Curiosity, pragmatism, and quasi-moral injunctions are all key to the rationalist project. Yet if you were to ask me which of these is most foundational, I would say: “curiosity.” I have my principles, and I have my plans, which may well tell me to look behind the curtain. But then, I also just really want to know. What will I see? The world has handed me a puzzle, and a solution feels tantalizingly close.
