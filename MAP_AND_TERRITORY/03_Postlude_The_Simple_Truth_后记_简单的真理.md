## 后记：简单的真理

> 我记得我写过一篇关于存在主义的论文。老师给了个不及格的分数。她把文中出现的“真实”和“真理”都划了线，大概有二十处，每处旁边都写了个问号。她想知道我说的“真理”到底是什么意思。
> ——丹妮尔·伊根，记者

这篇文章旨在恢复对真理的朴素看法。

有人对你说：“我的神奇蛇油能在三周内治愈你的肺癌。”你回答：“不是有临床试验证明这个说法不是真的吗？”对方反驳：“你说的‘真理’这个概念太天真了，你所谓的‘真实’到底是什么意思？”

很多人在被这样质问时，未必能用极其严密的细节来回答。但即便如此，他们也不会明智到放弃“真理”这个概念。曾经也没有人能用极其严密的细节写出引力方程，但如果你从悬崖上跳下去，你还是会摔下去。

我常常看到——尤其是在互联网邮件列表上——大家讨论到一半，有人说“X是真的”，然后就会有人开始争论“真”的用法。这篇文章并不是要成为那场争论的百科全书式参考资料。相反，我希望争论的人能读完这篇文章，然后回到他们原本讨论的话题上。

在这篇文章里，我会提出一些问题。如果你觉得某个答案显而易见，那很可能就是我想要的答案。显而易见的选择并不总是最好的选择，但有时候，它确实就是。找到一个显而易见的答案后，我不会立刻停止思考，但如果继续思考后，这个答案依然显而易见，我也不会因为保留它而感到愧疚。没错，大家都认为二加二等于四，大家都说二加二等于四，在日常生活中大家也都按二加二等于四来行动，但二加二究竟、最终等于多少？据我所知，还是四。即使我用庄重、深沉的语气提出这个问题，答案依然是四。

你觉得这个答案是不是太简单了？也许，这一次，生活真的不需要复杂化。那不是很让人耳目一新吗？

如果你是那种一开始就觉得这个问题很简单的人，我希望你读完后依然觉得它很简单。如果你被深奥的问题难住了，请记住：如果你完全知道一个系统是如何运作的，甚至可以用水桶和鹅卵石自己搭建一个，那它就不该对你来说是个谜。

如果你在解释隐喻时感到困惑，不妨试着把一切都完全按字面意思理解。

想象一下，在没有文字记载和正式数学的时代，我是一个牧羊人，总是为数羊而发愁。我的羊晚上睡在羊圈里，羊圈足够高，可以防止夜间出没的狼。每天早上我得把羊放出羊圈去吃草，晚上又得把羊找回来赶进羊圈。如果有羊落在外面，第二天早上我就会发现它的尸体，被狼咬死、吃掉了一半。但如果我明明知道羊大多都已经回圈了，还要花几个小时满地找最后一只羊，实在让人沮丧。有时候我早早放弃，通常也没事，但大约十分之一的情况下，第二天早上就会有一只死羊。

要是有办法能不用辛苦寻找就知道羊是不是还在外面就好了！我试过很多方法：掷我们部落的占卜棒，用心灵感应寻找羊的位置，努力为“所有羊都回圈了”找理由。这些方法都没用。每当我早早休息，第二天早上大约十分之一的概率会发现一只死羊。也许我意识到这些方法没用，也许我总能为每次失败找借口，但我的困境依然没有改变。我要么花一小时把每个角落都找遍——而大多数时候其实羊都已经回来了；要么早点睡觉，平均每十只羊就会丢一只。

有一天傍晚，我特别疲惫。我掷了占卜棒，结果显示所有羊都回来了。我在脑海里想象每个角落，也没“看到”有羊。我还是不太放心，于是又看了看羊圈，觉得里面羊挺多的，回想了一下自己今天找羊也很认真。这些都让我安心了些，于是我就去睡觉了。第二天早上，我发现有两只死羊。那一刻，我心里一根弦断了，开始动脑筋想新办法。

那天，羊圈门口传来一阵敲打声。

第二天早上，我只把羊圈门开一条缝，每有一只羊出圈，我就在门边的桶里丢一颗鹅卵石。下午，每有一只羊回来，我就从桶里拿出一颗鹅卵石。当桶里没有鹅卵石时，我就可以放心地不再找羊，安心休息。这是个天才的想法，将彻底改变牧羊业。

理论上如此。实际上，这个方法要经过不少改进才能真正可靠。有几次我找了几个小时也没发现羊，第二天早上也确实没有羊落单。每次遇到这种情况，我都得仔细思考到底哪里出了问题。有一次我回忆发现，开始用桶的时候桶里就已经有鹅卵石了——事实证明，这不是个好主意。还有一次，我在上午和下午之间随手往桶里扔鹅卵石取乐，后来找了几个小时才意识到这也是个坏主意。但我不断练习，终于成了一个相当熟练的“鹅卵石工匠”。

一天傍晚，一位身穿白袍、头戴月桂、脚穿凉鞋、还穿着西装的男子，沿着通往我牧场的沙路走来。

“我能帮你吗？”我问。

那人从外套里掏出一枚徽章，打开给我看，毫无疑问地证明他是罗马元老院的特使，名叫马可斯·索菲斯提库斯·马克西姆斯。（你可能会想，这徽章会不会被别人偷用？但这些徽章的力量如此之大，任何人只要用它，立刻就会变成马可斯本人。）

“叫我马克吧，”他说，“我是来代表元老院没收你的魔法鹅卵石的；如此强大的神器不能落入无知之人手中。”

“该死的学徒，”我低声抱怨，“又去村里乱说了。”然后看到马克严肃的脸，我叹了口气。“这不是魔法鹅卵石，”我大声说，“只是我随手捡的普通石头。”

马克脸上闪过一丝困惑，随即又恢复自信。“那我就是来拿魔法桶的！”他宣布。

“这也不是魔法桶，”我无奈地说，“我以前还用它装脏袜子呢。”

马克一脸疑惑。“那魔法在哪儿？”他质问。

这是个有趣的问题。“很难解释，”我说。

我的现任学徒奥特雷被动静吸引过来，主动解释道：“魔法在桶里的鹅卵石数量，”奥特雷说，“你必须让鹅卵石的数量正好对，否则就不会起作用。如果你多放几颗，或者少拿几颗，桶里的鹅卵石就不是‘魔法数量’了。现在，魔法数量大概是……”奥特雷探头看了看桶，“大约三分之一满。”

“明白了！”马克兴奋地说。他从后兜里掏出自己的桶和一堆鹅卵石，然后抓起一把鹅卵石塞进桶里。接着马克看了看桶里鹅卵石的数量。“好了，”马克说，“这个桶的魔法数量就是一半满。这样对吗？”

“不对！”奥特雷立刻说，“一半满不是魔法数量。魔法数量是三分之一满。一半满绝对不行。而且，你用的还是错的桶。”

马克转向我，一脸困惑。“你不是说桶不是魔法的吗？”

“不是，”我说。这时一只羊从门口走过，我又往桶里丢了一颗鹅卵石。“而且，我在看羊呢。你去问奥特雷吧。”

马克狐疑地看了我丢进去的鹅卵石一眼，但决定暂时搁置这个问题。他转向奥特雷，挺直身子，傲然说道：“这是自由国家，”马克说，“当然是在元老院仁慈独裁下的自由国家。我想往哪个桶里放鹅卵石就往哪个桶里放。”

奥特雷想了想，“你不能随便放，”他最后说，“那样就没有魔法了。”

“听着，”马克耐心地说，“我仔细观察过你。你看了看桶，数了鹅卵石，然后说这就是魔法数量。我做的和你一模一样。”

“不是这样的，”奥特雷说。

“哦，我明白了，”马克说，“不是我桶里的鹅卵石数量有魔法，而是你桶里的鹅卵石数量有魔法。你是这么说的吗？那你的桶凭什么比我的桶厉害？”

“嗯，”奥特雷说，“如果我们把你的桶倒空，再把我桶里的鹅卵石全倒进你的桶，那你的桶就有魔法数量了。我们还有个办法可以检查你的桶是不是有魔法数量，只要我们知道我桶里有魔法数量；我们把这叫做‘桶比较操作’。”

又有一只羊经过，我又往桶里丢了一颗鹅卵石。

“他又丢了一颗鹅卵石！”马克说，“我猜你现在会说新的鹅卵石数量也是魔法数量？我可以往你的桶里丢鹅卵石，直到和我的桶一样多，然后我们的桶就会一致。你其实就是在拿我的桶和你的桶比较，来判断你觉得哪个数量是‘魔法’。好吧，我觉得你的桶不是魔法的，因为它的鹅卵石数量和我的不一样。就这样！”

“等等，”奥特雷说，“你没明白——”

“你说的‘魔法数量’，其实就是你自己桶里的鹅卵石数量。而我说的‘魔法数量’，就是我自己桶里的鹅卵石数量。所以你看我的桶，说它‘不是魔法’，但‘魔法’这个词对不同的人有不同的意思。你得说明是谁的魔法。你应该说我的桶没有‘奥特雷的魔法数量’，而我说你的桶没有‘马克的魔法数量’。这样一来，表面上的矛盾就消失了。”

“可是——”奥特雷无助地说。

“不同的人可以有不同的桶，里面鹅卵石数量也不同，这就证明‘魔法’这回事完全是任意的、主观的。”

“马克，”我说，“有人告诉过你这些鹅卵石是干什么用的吗？”

“干什么？”马克说，“我以为它们只是魔法。”

“如果鹅卵石什么用都没有，”奥特雷说，“我们那位ISO 9000流程效率审计员早就把这套流程从我们日常工作里删掉了。”

“你们的审计员叫什么名字？”

“达尔文，”奥特雷说。

“嗯，”马克说，“查尔斯确实以严格著称。那么这些鹅卵石是给羊群带来祝福，让羊变多吗？”

“不是，”我说，“鹅卵石的妙处在于：如果我们看桶，发现桶里没有鹅卵石，就知道牧场上也没有羊。如果不用桶，我们就得一直找羊直到天黑，以防还有一只羊没回来。或者我们提前收工，第二天早上就可能发现一只死羊，因为狼会咬死任何落单的羊。如果我们看桶，就知道所有羊都回来了，可以安心休息。”

马克思考了一下，“听起来不太靠谱，”他最后说，“你们考虑过用占卜棒吗？占卜棒是绝对灵验的，至少，谁要是说它们不灵就会被烧死。这种死法极其痛苦，所以占卜棒一定是绝对灵验的。”

“你愿意用占卜棒就用吧，”我说。

“哦，天哪，当然不会，”马克说，“它们确实每次都灵验，完美无缺，堪称神圣工具。但万一第二天早上真有只死羊怎么办？我只在绝对不会被证伪的时候才用占卜棒，否则我可能会被活活烧死。那么，你们的魔法桶到底是怎么工作的？”

魔法桶是怎么工作的……？我还是从最简单的情况说起吧。“这样，”我说，“假设牧场上没有羊，但桶里还有鹅卵石。那我们就会浪费几个小时去找根本不存在的羊。如果牧场上还有羊，但桶已经空了，那我和奥特雷就会太早收工，第二天早上就会发现死羊。所以，只有当桶是空的，牧场上也没有羊时，空桶才是魔法的——”

“等等，”奥特雷说，“这听起来像是废话的同义反复。空桶和空牧场本来就是一回事吧？”

“这不是废话，”我说，“打个比方：逻辑学家塔尔斯基曾说，‘雪是白的’这个断言为真，当且仅当雪是白的。如果你能理解这个，就能明白为什么只有当牧场上没有羊时，空桶才是魔法的。”

“等等，”马克说，“这只是桶，和羊没关系。桶和羊显然完全不同，它们之间不可能有任何互动。”

“那你觉得魔法从哪儿来的？”奥特雷问。

马克思考了一下，“你说可以比较两个桶，看鹅卵石数量是不是一样……我能理解桶和桶之间可以互动。也许当你有一大堆桶，而且它们鹅卵石数量都一样时，就会产生魔法。我把这叫做‘一致性魔法桶理论’。”

“有意思，”奥特雷说，“我知道我师父正在研究多桶系统——他说这样可能更好，因为有‘冗余’和‘纠错’。这听起来就像一致性理论。”

“其实还不完全一样——”我刚想说。

“让我们来检验一下魔法一致性理论吧，”奥特雷说，“我看到你背后口袋里还有五个桶。我把我们正在用的这个桶递给你，然后你可以把其他桶都装到同样的高度——”

马克惊恐地往后一缩。“停！这些桶是我们家族世代相传的，它们一直都是同一个高度！如果我接受你的桶，我的桶就会变得不一致，魔法就会消失！”

“可你现在的这些桶和羊根本没关系！”奥特雷抗议道。

马克一脸无奈。“听着，我之前已经解释过了，羊和桶之间显然不可能有任何互动。桶只能和其他桶互动。”

“每当有羊经过，我就往桶里丢一颗鹅卵石。”我提醒道。

“羊经过时你往桶里丢鹅卵石？”马克说，“这和事情有什么关系？”

“这是羊和鹅卵石之间的互动。”我回答。

“不，那是鹅卵石和你之间的互动。”马克说，“魔法不是来自羊，而是来自你。羊本身显然没有魔法。魔法必须在通往桶的路上从某处产生。”

我指了指门口架着的一个木制装置。“你看到那个木头机关上垂下来的布条了吗？我们还在调试它——现在还不太稳定——但当羊经过时，它会碰到布条。布条被拨开时，一个鹅卵石就会从储存槽里掉进桶里。这样我和奥特雷就不用自己动手丢鹅卵石了。”

马克皱起眉头。“我不太明白……那块布是魔法的吗？”

我耸耸肩。“我是在网上一家叫‘自然选择’的公司买的。这种布料叫‘感官模态’。”我停顿了一下，看到马克和奥特雷满脸难以置信的表情。“我承认这些名字有点新世纪风格。关键是，羊经过时会触发一连串因果链，最终让鹅卵石掉进桶里。之后你可以把这个桶和其他桶比较，等等。”

“我还是不明白，”马克说，“你又不能把羊塞进桶里，只有鹅卵石能进桶，很明显鹅卵石只能和鹅卵石互动。”

“羊会和能影响鹅卵石的东西互动……”我努力找个类比，“比如你低头看鞋带。一颗光子从太阳发出，穿过地球大气层，反射到你的鞋带上，再穿过你眼睛的瞳孔，打在视网膜上，被视杆细胞或视锥细胞吸收。光子的能量让神经元放电，进而引发其他神经元放电。你大脑视觉皮层的神经激活模式可以和你关于鞋带的信念互动，因为这些信念同样存在于神经底层。如果你能理解这个，你就能明白为什么羊经过时会让鹅卵石进桶。”

“鹅卵石到底在哪个环节变成魔法的？”马克问。

“它……呃……”我开始有点困惑。我甩甩头想让自己清醒点。今天早上醒来时这一切还很简单，鹅卵石和桶的系统也没变复杂。“如果你记得这个系统的目的是为了记录羊的数量，就会容易理解多了。”

马克叹了口气。“算了……很明显你也不知道。也许所有鹅卵石一开始就是魔法的，甚至还没进桶就已经有魔法了。我们可以把这种观点叫做‘泛鹅卵石主义’。”

“哈！”奥特雷冷笑道，语气里满是讥讽，“那只是痴心妄想！不是所有鹅卵石生来都一样。你桶里的鹅卵石根本没有魔法。它们只是普通的石头！”

马克的脸色变得严肃。“现在，”他喊道，“你终于明白你们这条路的危险了！一旦你说有些人的鹅卵石有魔法，有些没有，你的傲慢就会吞噬你！你会觉得自己高人一等，最终自取灭亡！历史上有多少人因为自以为自己的鹅卵石至高无上而折磨、杀害他人！”马克的语气里带上了些许居高临下，“把某个桶里的鹅卵石数量奉为‘魔法’，就意味着你相信有一个至高无上的魔法桶。现在没人相信什么至高魔法桶了。”

“一，”我说，“羊不是绝对的鹅卵石。二，我也不觉得我的桶真的装着羊。三，我也没把我的桶当作完美的——我有时还会调整它——我这么做是因为我在乎羊。”

“而且，”奥特雷说，“如果有人认为拥有绝对鹅卵石就可以为所欲为，那是他自己的错误，和桶没关系。你解决错了问题。”

马克平静下来。“我想我不能指望你们这些牧羊人能更好。你们大概还相信雪是白的吧。”

“呃……是的？”奥特雷说。

“你就不在意约瑟夫·斯大林也相信雪是白的吗？”

“呃……不在意？”奥特雷说。

马克难以置信地看着奥特雷，最后耸耸肩。“好吧，就算只是假设你的鹅卵石有魔法，我的没有。你能告诉我区别在哪吗？”

“我的鹅卵石代表羊！”奥特雷得意地说，“你的鹅卵石没有代表性，所以没用。它们没有意义。你看，它们没有语义光环，只是普通鹅卵石。你需要一个有特殊因果能力的桶。”

“啊！”马克说，“特殊因果能力，而不是魔法。”

“没错，”奥特雷说，“我可不迷信。在这个时代，宣称魔法是国际牧羊界无法接受的。我们发现，假设魔法根本无法解释牧羊现象。所以当我遇到不懂的事，想用一个没有内部细节、连事后都无法做出预测的模型来解释时，我就假设有特殊因果能力。或者我会说那是‘涌现现象’之类的。”

“那桶到底有什么特殊能力？”马克问。

“嗯，”奥特雷说，“也许这个桶和牧场之间有一种‘关于性’关系。这就能解释为什么它有用——当桶是空的，就意味着牧场也是空的。”

“你是在哪儿找到这个桶的？”马克问，“你怎么发现它和牧场有‘关于性’关系？”

“这就是普通的桶，”我说，“我以前还拿它爬树玩……我觉得这个问题其实没那么难。”

“我是在问奥特雷。”马克说。

“你得用魔法仪式——哦不，是我师父发现的、具有特殊因果能力的涌现过程——把桶和牧场绑定起来，把鹅卵石和羊绑定起来。”奥特雷解释道。

奥特雷试图描述这套仪式，马克则一脸贤者般的理解，不断点头。

“你是不是每次有羊从门出去就扔一颗鹅卵石进去？”马克问，“每次有羊回来就拿出一颗鹅卵石？”

奥特雷点头：“对。”

“那一定很难吧。”马克同情地说。

奥特雷顿时精神一振，像雨水滋润干涸的土地一样吸收着马克的同情。“没错！”奥特雷说，“这对情感来说极其艰难。当桶的水位保持一段时间后，你……会对那个水位产生感情。”

这时有只羊经过，从门口出去。奥特雷看见了，弯腰捡起一颗鹅卵石，高高举起。“看啊！”奥特雷高声宣布，“有只羊通过了！我现在必须把一颗鹅卵石扔进这个桶里，我亲爱的桶啊，毁掉那长久以来保持的美好水位——”又有一只羊经过。奥特雷正沉浸在自己的戏剧表演中，没注意到，于是我帮他把一颗鹅卵石丢进桶里。奥特雷还在说：“——因为这正是牧羊人的终极考验，无论多么痛苦，无论旧水位多么珍贵，都要扔进鹅卵石。的确，只有最优秀的牧羊人才配得上如此严苛的要求——”

“奥特雷，”我说，“如果你想有朝一日成为伟大的牧羊人，学会闭嘴，把鹅卵石扔进去。别磨叽，别煽情，直接做就行了。”

“而这个仪式，”马克说，“是通过共感律和感染律把鹅卵石和羊绑定起来，就像巫毒娃娃一样。”

奥特雷皱眉，四下张望。“拜托！别说什么共感律和感染律。我们牧羊人是反迷信的。用‘意向性’这种说法吧，听起来科学点。”

“我能看看鹅卵石吗？”马克问。

“当然。”我说。我从桶里拿出一颗鹅卵石，扔给马克。然后我又从地上捡起一颗鹅卵石，丢进桶里。

奥特雷疑惑地看着我：“你不是把顺序搞乱了吗？”

我耸耸肩：“我觉得没事。如果第二天早上发现有死羊，或者我们找了几个小时都没找到羊，那就说明我搞砸了。”

“可是——”奥特雷还想说。

“我教给你的只是你现在知道的，但我还没把我知道的一切都教给你。”我说。

马克正仔细端详着鹅卵石，目不转睛。他把手放在鹅卵石上方，嘴里念念有词，然后摇摇头：“我没感受到任何魔力。哦，抱歉，我没感受到任何意向性。”

“鹅卵石只有在放在魔——呃，‘涌现桶’里的时候才有意向性，”奥特雷说，“否则它就只是普通鹅卵石。”

“没关系，”我说。我从桶里拿出一颗鹅卵石，扔到一边。然后走到马克身边，拍了拍他拿着鹅卵石的手，说：“我宣布这只手现在是魔法桶的一部分！”然后我又回到门口继续守着。

奥特雷笑了：“你这就是纯粹的恶作剧。”

我点点头，确实如此。

“不过，这真的有用吗？”奥特雷问。

我又点点头，希望自己是对的。我以前用两个桶试过，理论上马克的手和桶没什么区别。即使马克的手里有区分活物和死物的‘生命力’，这个方法也应该和他是一尊大理石雕像时一样有效。

马克有些不安地看着自己的手。“所以……鹅卵石现在又有意向性了吗？”

“没错，”我说。“别再往你手里加鹅卵石，也别扔掉你手里的那颗，否则仪式就会失效。”

马克郑重地点点头，然后继续仔细端详那颗鹅卵石。“我现在明白你的羊群为什么能养得这么大了，”马克说，“有了这个桶的力量，你可以不断往里扔鹅卵石，羊就会不断从牧场回来。你可以只养几只羊，让它们离开，然后在它们回来前把桶装满。要是养太多羊觉得麻烦，你可以让它们全都离开，再把桶里的鹅卵石几乎全倒出来，只留几颗，这样回来就只有几只羊……等到剪羊毛的时候再让羊群变多……天哪，伙计！你知道你发现的这个仪式有多强大吗？我只能想象它的影响力；人类社会也许会因此跃进十年——不，百年！”

“事情不是这样的，”我说。“如果你在没有羊离开时加鹅卵石，或者在没有羊回来时拿走鹅卵石，仪式就会失效。力量不会留在鹅卵石里，而是会像肥皂泡一样瞬间消失。”

马克的表情极度失望。“你确定吗？”

我点点头。“我试过了，确实不行。”

马克重重叹了口气。“而这……数学……在那之前看起来还那么强大、那么有用……唉。人类进步也就到此为止了。”

“马克，这是个很棒的想法，”奥特雷鼓励道，“我都没想到这一点，而且其实很显然……这能省下大量精力……一定有办法能让你的计划奏效！我们可以试试不同的桶，看看能不能找到一个能让魔法——呃，意向性留在鹅卵石里的桶，即使没有仪式也行。或者换别的鹅卵石。也许我们用的鹅卵石本身就不适合拥有固有意向性。要不我们试试用雕成小羊的石头？或者直接在鹅卵石上写‘羊’，说不定就够了。”

“不会有用的，”我干巴巴地预测道。

奥特雷还在继续。“也许我们需要有机鹅卵石，而不是硅石鹅卵石……或者我们得用昂贵的宝石。宝石的价格每十八个月翻一倍，所以你现在可以买一把便宜宝石，等二十年后就会变得很贵。”

“你试过加鹅卵石来创造更多羊，结果没成功？”马克问我，“你到底怎么做的？”

“我拿了一把美元纸币。然后我把纸币一张张藏到毯子下，每藏一张，就从盒子里拿一个回形针，堆成一小堆。我特意不在脑子里记数，只知道有‘很多’纸币和‘很多’回形针。等所有纸币都藏好后，我又多加了一个回形针，相当于多扔了一颗鹅卵石进桶。然后我开始把纸币从毯子下拿出来，同时把回形针放回盒子。等我做完后，手里还剩下一个回形针。”

“这个结果说明什么？”奥特雷问。

“说明这个把戏没用。只要我在某一步打破了仪式，力量就不会残留，而是瞬间消失；回形针堆和纸币堆再也不会同时清空。”

“你真的做过这个实验？”马克问。

“是的，”我说，“我真的做过实验，验证结果和理论预测一致。我对科学方法有种感情依恋，即使看起来很荒谬也要试试。万一我错了呢？”

“要是成功了，”马克说，“你就犯了伪造货币罪！想象一下如果每个人都这么做，经济就会崩溃！每个人都会有几十亿美元的货币，但却买不到任何东西！”

“一点也不会，”我答道，“按照你说的逻辑，如果多加一个回形针能创造一美元，那多创造一美元也会创造出等值的商品和服务。”

马克摇摇头。“伪造货币依然是犯罪……你就不该尝试。”

“我很有把握自己会失败。”

“哈！”马克说，“你本来就预期会失败！你根本不相信自己能做到！”

“确实如此，”我承认，“你准确猜中了我的预期。”

“这就是问题所在，”马克干脆地说，“魔法靠的是信念和意志力。如果你不相信自己能做到，那你就做不到。要想改变实验结果，首先得改变你对结果的信念。”

“有意思，”我怀念地说，“当初我把鹅卵石和桶的方法告诉奥特雷时，他也是这么说的。他觉得这太荒谬了，根本不信，所以对他来说不会奏效。”

“那你怎么说服他的？”马克问。

“我让他闭嘴照做，”我说，“等方法奏效了，奥特雷就开始相信了。”

马克皱眉，困惑地说：“这说不通啊。这没解决本质上的‘先有鸡还是先有蛋’的问题。”

“其实解决了。无论你信不信，桶法都能用。”

“荒谬！”马克气急败坏地说，“我不相信有那种无论信不信都能用的魔法！”

“我当时也这么说，”奥特雷插话道，“结果显然我错了。”

马克皱着眉头努力思考。“可是……如果你并不相信‘无论你信不信都能生效的魔法’，那为什么你在不相信的情况下用桶法还是成功了？难道你相信‘无论你信不信都能生效的魔法’，而且你还相信‘无论你信不信都能生效的魔法’无论你信不信‘无论你信不信都能生效的魔法’？”

“我……不这么认为……”奥特雷迟疑地说。

“那如果你不相信‘无论你信不信都能生效的魔法’……等等，我得用纸和笔算算——”马克疯狂地写写画画，看着结果半信半疑，又把纸倒过来看，最后放弃了。“算了，”马克说，“魔法本身我都难以理解，元魔法就更别提了。”

“马克，我觉得你没理解桶艺的精髓，”我说，“这不是用鹅卵石控制羊，而是让羊控制鹅卵石。在这门艺术里，你不需要一开始就相信它会奏效。相反，是先奏效了，你才会相信它。”

“或者说你相信如此。”马克说。

“我确实相信，”我答道，“因为事实就是如此。现实和我信念之间的对应关系，是现实控制我的信念，而不是反过来。”

又有一只羊经过，我又丢进一颗鹅卵石。

“啊！现在我们终于到了问题的根源，”马克说，“你说的这个‘现实’到底是什么？我明白一个假说可以优雅、可证伪、与证据相符。但我听你说‘信念真实’、‘信念符合现实’这些，其实不过是说你相信某事，或者你‘真的真的’相信某事。”

我停顿了一下。“嗯……”我慢慢地说，“说实话，我自己也不太确定‘现实’这个概念从哪儿来的。我没法在实验室里创造自己的现实，所以我大概还没真正理解它。但有时候我非常确信某件事会发生，结果却发生了别的事。我需要给那个决定实验结果的‘某物’起个名字，所以我叫它‘现实’。这个‘现实’和我最好的假说也有区别。即使我有一个简单、被所有已知证据强力支持的假说，有时我还是会被现实惊到。所以我需要用不同的词来区分决定我预测的‘东西’和决定实验结果的‘东西’。前者我叫‘信念’，后者我叫‘现实’。”

马克哼了一声。“我都不知道为什么还要听你这些明显的胡说。你说的所谓‘现实’，其实也只是另一种信念。就连你相信‘现实先于信念’也是一种信念。逻辑上必然得出，现实并不存在，只有信念存在。”

“等一下，”奥特雷说，“你能把刚才那句再说一遍吗？你中间突然转了个弯，我没跟上。”

“不管你怎么说现实，它都只是另一种信念，”马克解释道，“所以逻辑上必然得出，现实不存在，只有信念存在。”

“我明白了，”我说，“就像无论你吃什么，都得用嘴吃。所以得出结论：根本没有食物，只有嘴。”

“正是如此，”马克说，“你吃的所有东西都必须进你嘴里。怎么可能有嘴外的食物？这想法太荒谬了，证明‘食物’这个概念根本不成立。所以我们都快饿死了，因为没有食物。”

奥特雷低头看看自己的肚子。“可我并没有饿死啊。”

“哈！”马克得意地喊道，“你刚才是怎么反驳的？用嘴说的，朋友！用嘴！这难道不是最好的证明，说明根本没有食物吗？”

“你们说什么饿死？”身后突然传来一个粗哑的声音。奥特雷和我很淡定，因为我们经历过多次。马克却被吓得跳了起来，差点魂飞魄散。

达尔文督察露出一丝得意的微笑，显然对自己的突然出现很满意，还在记录板上打了个勾。

“只是打个比方！”马克赶紧说，“您不用把我的嘴拿走，真的——”

“既然没有食物，你还要嘴干什么？”达尔文生气地说，“算了，我没空管这些蠢事。我是来检查羊群的。”

“羊群很兴旺，长官，”我说，“一月以来没有死羊。”

“很好。我奖励你0.12单位适应度。那这个人是谁？他是必要的工作人员吗？”

“在我看来，他要是被当作热气球的压舱物吊起来，对人类更有用。”我说。

“好狠啊。”奥特雷温和地说。

“我不关心人类。让他自己说。”

马克傲慢地挺直身子。“这个区区牧羊人，”他指着我说，“声称有‘现实’这种东西。这让我很不爽，因为我深信没有真理。‘真理’这个概念只是人们用来把自己信念强加给别人的手段。每个文化都有不同的‘真理’，没有哪个文化的‘真理’更高明。我说的这些在任何时候、任何地方都成立，我坚持你们必须同意。”

“等一下，”奥特雷说，“如果什么都不是真的，那你说‘什么都不是真的’时我为什么要信？”

“我没说什么都是真的——”马克说。

“你说了，”奥特雷插嘴，“我听见了。”

“——我是说‘真理’只是某些文化用来强制别人接受自己信念的借口。所以当你说某事‘是真的’，其实只是对你自己群体有利而已。”

“那你刚才说的这些，”我问，“是真的吗？”

“绝对、肯定是真的！”马克斩钉截铁地说，“人是自己创造现实的。”

“等等，”奥特雷又疑惑了，“说‘人创造自己的现实’在逻辑上和‘没有真理’完全是两回事，我甚至无法想象‘没有真理’到底怎么运作，也许是因为你还没解释清楚——”

“你又来了，”马克不耐烦地说，“又想用你们西方的逻辑、理性、推理、一致性这些概念。”

“好吧，”奥特雷嘀咕，“看来我得再加个主题标签，专门记录你这完全不同的新观点——”

“这不是分开的，”马克说，“你把我的话当成假设，仔细推导其后果，这种态度就错了。你应该把它们当作通用的借口，只要有人说了我不喜欢的话，我就用这个借口。这不是解释宇宙如何运作的模型，而是一张‘免死金牌’。关键是要有选择地使用这个借口。当我说‘没有真理这种东西’时，这只适用于你说‘魔法桶无论我信不信都能用’的情况。可这并不适用于我说‘没有真理这种东西’这句话。”

“呃……为什么不适用？”奥特雷问。

马克耐心地叹了口气：“奥特雷，你以为你是第一个想到这个问题的人吗？问我们如果所有信念都没有意义，我们自己的信念又怎么有意义？很多学生第一次接触这种哲学时都会问同样的问题，你要知道，这种哲学有很多追随者，还有大量文献。”

“那答案是什么？”奥特雷问。

“我们把它叫做‘反身性问题’，”马克解释道。

“但答案到底是什么？”奥特雷追问。

马克带着居高临下的微笑说：“相信我，奥特雷，你不是第一个想到这么简单问题的人。你没必要把它当作什么决定性的反驳抛给我们。”

“但实际答案是什么？”

“现在，我想转到‘逻辑如何杀死可爱小海豹’这个话题——”

“你在浪费时间。”达尔文督察厉声打断。

“而且还把羊都忘了。”我说，同时又丢进一颗鹅卵石。

达尔文督察看着这两个争论者，显然谁也不肯让步。“听着，”达尔文这次语气温和些，“我有个简单的办法可以解决你们的争论。你说，”他指着马克，“人们的信念能改变他们个人的现实。你，”他把手指转向奥特雷，“坚信马克的信念无法改变现实。那么让马克拼命相信自己能飞，然后从悬崖上跳下去。马克会看到自己像鸟一样飞走，奥特雷会看到他掉下去摔成肉饼，这样你们俩都满意了。”

我们都停下来，思考这个建议。

“听起来挺合理的……”马克最后说。

“悬崖就在那边。”达尔文督察提醒。

奥特雷一脸专注，突然大喊：“等等！如果真是这样，我们早就各自进入自己的私人宇宙了，这样的话，其他人其实只是你想象出来的幻影——那就没必要向我们证明什么——”

这时，附近的悬崖上传来一声渐远的尖叫，接着是沉闷孤独的一声闷响。达尔文督察翻开记录板，在基因库那一页上把马克的等位基因频率稍微往下记了一点。

奥特雷脸色有点发白。“这真的有必要吗？”

“有必要？”达尔文督察疑惑地说，“这只是发生了……我不太明白你的问题。”

我和奥特雷又回头看向我们的桶。是时候把羊赶回来了。你可不能忘了这件事。不然，其他一切还有什么意义呢？

## Postlude: The Simple Truth

> I remember this paper I wrote on existentialism. My teacher gave it back with an F. She’d underlined true and truth wherever it appeared in the essay, probably about twenty times, with a question mark beside each. She wanted to know what I meant by truth.
> --Danielle Egan, journalist

This essay is meant to restore a naive view of truth.

Someone says to you: “My miracle snake oil can rid you of lung cancer in just three weeks.” You reply: “Didn’t a clinical study show this claim to be untrue?” The one returns: “This notion of ‘truth’ is quite naive; what do you mean by ‘true’?”

Many people, so questioned, don’t know how to answer in exquisitely rigorous detail. Nonetheless they would not be wise to abandon the concept of “truth.” There was a time when no one knew the equations of gravity in exquisitely rigorous detail, yet if you walked off a cliff, you would fall.

Often I have seen—especially on Internet mailing lists—that amidst other conversation, someone says “X is true,” and then an argument breaks out over the use of the word “true.” This essay is not meant as an encyclopedic reference for that argument. Rather, I hope the arguers will read this essay, and then go back to whatever they were discussing before someone questioned the nature of truth.

In this essay I pose questions. If you see what seems like a really obvious answer, it’s probably the answer I intend. The obvious choice isn’t always the best choice, but sometimes, by golly, it is. I don’t stop looking as soon I find an obvious answer, but if I go on looking, and the obvious-seeming answer still seems obvious, I don’t feel guilty about keeping it. Oh, sure, everyone thinks two plus two is four, everyone says two plus two is four, and in the mere mundane drudgery of everyday life everyone behaves as if two plus two is four, but what does two plus two really, ultimately equal? As near as I can figure, four. It’s still four even if I intone the question in a solemn, portentous tone of voice.

Does that seem like an unduly simple answer? Maybe, on this occasion, life doesn’t need to be complicated. Wouldn’t that be refreshing?

If you are one of those fortunate folk to whom the question seems trivial at the outset, I hope it still seems trivial at the finish. If you find yourself stumped by deep and meaningful questions, remember that if you know exactly how a system works, and could build one yourself out of buckets and pebbles, it should not be a mystery to you. 

If confusion threatens when you interpret a metaphor as a metaphor, try taking everything completely literally.

Imagine that in an era before recorded history or formal mathematics, I am a shepherd and I have trouble tracking my sheep. My sheep sleep in an enclosure, a fold; and the enclosure is high enough to guard my sheep from wolves that roam by night. Each day I must release my sheep from the fold to pasture and graze; each night I must find my sheep and return them to the fold. If a sheep is left outside, I will find its body the next morning, killed and half-eaten by wolves. But it is so discouraging, to scour the fields for hours, looking for one last sheep, when I know that probably all the sheep are in the fold. Sometimes I give up early, and usually I get away with it; but around a tenth of the time there is a dead sheep the next morning.

If only there were some way to divine whether sheep are still grazing, without the inconvenience of looking! I try several methods: I toss the divination sticks of my tribe; I train my psychic powers to locate sheep through clairvoyance; I search carefully for reasons to believe all the sheep are in the fold. It makes no difference. Around a tenth of the times I turn in early, I find a dead sheep the next morning. Perhaps I realize that my methods aren’t working, and perhaps I carefully excuse each failure; but my dilemma is still the same. I can spend an hour searching every possible nook and cranny, when most of the time there are no remaining sheep; or I can go to sleep early and lose, on the average, one-tenth of a sheep.

Late one afternoon I feel especially tired. I toss the divination sticks and the divination sticks say that all the sheep have returned. I visualize each nook and cranny, and I don’t imagine scrying any sheep. I’m still not confident enough, so I look inside the fold and it seems like there are a lot of sheep, and I review my earlier efforts and decide that I was especially diligent. This dissipates my anxiety, and I go to sleep. The next morning I discover two dead sheep. Something inside me snaps, and I begin thinking creatively.

That day, loud hammering noises come from the gate of the sheepfold’s enclosure.

The next morning, I open the gate of the enclosure only a little way, and as each sheep passes out of the enclosure, I drop a pebble into a bucket nailed up next to the door. In the afternoon, as each returning sheep passes by, I take one pebble out of the bucket. When there are no pebbles left in the bucket, I can stop searching and turn in for the night. It is a brilliant notion. It will revolutionize shepherding.

That was the theory. In practice, it took considerable refinement before the method worked reliably. Several times I searched for hours and didn’t find any sheep, and the next morning there were no stragglers. On each of these occasions it required deep thought to figure out where my bucket system had failed. On returning from one fruitless search, I thought back and realized that the bucket already contained pebbles when I started; this, it turned out, was a bad idea. Another time I randomly tossed pebbles into the bucket, to amuse myself, between the morning and the afternoon; this too was a bad idea, as I realized after searching for a few hours. But I practiced my pebblecraft, and became a reasonably proficient pebblecrafter.

One afternoon, a man richly attired in white robes, leafy laurels, sandals, and business suit trudges in along the sandy trail that leads to my pastures.

“Can I help you?” I inquire.

The man takes a badge from his coat and flips it open, proving beyond the shadow of a doubt that he is Markos Sophisticus Maximus, a delegate from the Senate of Rum. (One might wonder whether another could steal the badge; but so great is the power of these badges that if any other were to use them, they would in that instant be transformed into Markos.)

“Call me Mark,” he says. “I’m here to confiscate the magic pebbles, in the name of the Senate; artifacts of such great power must not fall into ignorant hands.”

“That bleedin’ apprentice,” I grouse under my breath, “he’s been yakkin’ to the villagers again.” Then I look at Mark’s stern face, and sigh. “They aren’t magic pebbles,” I say aloud. “Just ordinary stones I picked up from the ground.”

A flicker of confusion crosses Mark’s face, then he brightens again. “I’m here for the magic bucket!” he declares.

“It’s not a magic bucket,” I say wearily. “I used to keep dirty socks in it.”

Mark’s face is puzzled. “Then where is the magic?” he demands.

An interesting question. “It’s hard to explain,” I say.

My current apprentice, Autrey, attracted by the commotion, wanders over and volunteers his explanation: “It’s the level of pebbles in the bucket,” Autrey says. “There’s a magic level of pebbles, and you have to get the level just right, or it doesn’t work. If you throw in more pebbles, or take some out, the bucket won’t be at the magic level anymore. Right now, the magic level is,” Autrey peers into the bucket, “about one-third full.”

“I see!” Mark says excitedly. From his back pocket Mark takes out his own bucket, and a heap of pebbles. Then he grabs a few handfuls of pebbles, and stuffs them into the bucket. Then Mark looks into the bucket, noting how many pebbles are there. “There we go,” Mark says, “the magic level of this bucket is half full. Like that?”

“No!” Autrey says sharply. “Half full is not the magic level. The magic level is about one-third. Half full is definitely unmagic. Furthermore, you’re using the wrong bucket.”

Mark turns to me, puzzled. “I thought you said the bucket wasn’t magic?”

“It’s not,” I say. A sheep passes out through the gate, and I toss another pebble into the bucket. “Besides, I’m watching the sheep. Talk to Autrey.”

Mark dubiously eyes the pebble I tossed in, but decides to temporarily shelve the question. Mark turns to Autrey and draws himself up haughtily. “It’s a free country,” Mark says, “under the benevolent dictatorship of the Senate, of course. I can drop whichever pebbles I like into whatever bucket I like.”

Autrey considers this. “No you can’t,” he says finally, “there won’t be any magic.”

“Look,” says Mark patiently, “I watched you carefully. You looked in your bucket, checked the level of pebbles, and called that the magic level. I did exactly the same thing.”

“That’s not how it works,” says Autrey.

“Oh, I see,” says Mark, “It’s not the level of pebbles in my bucket that’s magic, it’s the level of pebbles in your bucket. Is that what you claim? What makes your bucket so much better than mine, huh?”

“Well,” says Autrey, “if we were to empty your bucket, and then pour all the pebbles from my bucket into your bucket, then your bucket would have the magic level. There’s also a procedure we can use to check if your bucket has the magic level, if we know that my bucket has the magic level; we call that a bucket compare operation.”

Another sheep passes, and I toss in another pebble.

“He just tossed in another pebble!” Mark says. “And I suppose you claim the new level is also magic? I could toss pebbles into your bucket until the level was the same as mine, and then our buckets would agree. You’re just comparing my bucket to your bucket to determine whether you think the level is ‘magic’ or not. Well, I think your bucket isn’t magic, because it doesn’t have the same level of pebbles as mine. So there!”

“Wait,” says Autrey, “you don’t understand—”

“By ‘magic level,’ you mean simply the level of pebbles in your own bucket. And when I say ‘magic level,’ I mean the level of pebbles in my bucket. Thus you look at my bucket and say it ‘isn’t magic,’ but the word ‘magic’ means different things to different people. You need to specify whose magic it is. You should say that my bucket doesn’t have ‘Autrey’s magic level,’ and I say that your bucket doesn’t have ‘Mark’s magic level.’ That way, the apparent contradiction goes away.”

“But—” says Autrey helplessly.

“Different people can have different buckets with different levels of pebbles, which proves this business about ‘magic’ is completely arbitrary and subjective.”

“Mark,” I say, “did anyone tell you what these pebbles do?”

“Do?” says Mark. “I thought they were just magic.”

“If the pebbles didn’t do anything,” says Autrey, “our ISO 9000 process efficiency auditor would eliminate the procedure from our daily work.”

“What’s your auditor’s name?”

“Darwin,” says Autrey.

“Hm,” says Mark. “Charles does have a reputation as a strict auditor. So do the pebbles bless the flocks, and cause the increase of sheep?”

“No,” I say. “The virtue of the pebbles is this; if we look into the bucket and see the bucket is empty of pebbles, we know the pastures are likewise empty of sheep. If we do not use the bucket, we must search and search until dark, lest one last sheep remain. Or if we stop our work early, then sometimes the next morning we find a dead sheep, for the wolves savage any sheep left outside. If we look in the bucket, we know when all the sheep are home, and we can retire without fear.”

Mark considers this. “That sounds rather implausible,” he says eventually. “Did you consider using divination sticks? Divination sticks are infallible, or at least, anyone who says they are fallible is burned at the stake. This is an extremely painful way to die, so the divination sticks must be extremely infallible.”

“You’re welcome to use divination sticks if you like,” I say.

“Oh, good heavens, of course not,” says Mark. “They work infallibly, with absolute perfection on every occasion, as befits such blessed instruments. But what if there were a dead sheep the next morning? I only use the divination sticks when there is no possibility of their being proven wrong. Otherwise I might be burned alive. So how does your magic bucket work?”

How does the bucket work . . . ? I’d better start with the simplest possible case. “Well,” I say, “suppose the pastures are empty, and the bucket isn’t empty. Then we’ll waste hours looking for a sheep that isn’t there. And if there are sheep in the pastures, but the bucket is empty, then Autrey and I will turn in too early, and we’ll find dead sheep the next morning. So an empty bucket is magical if and only if the pastures are empty—”

“Hold on,” says Autrey. “That sounds like a vacuous tautology to me. Aren’t an empty bucket and empty pastures obviously the same thing?”

“It’s not vacuous,” I say. “Here’s an analogy: The logician Alfred Tarski once said that the assertion ‘Snow is white’ is true if and only if snow is white. If you can understand that, you should be able to see why an empty bucket is magical if and only if the pastures are empty of sheep.”

“Hold on,” says Mark. “These are buckets. They don’t have anything to do with sheep. Buckets and sheep are obviously completely different. There’s no way the sheep can ever interact with the bucket.”

“Then where do you think the magic comes from?” inquires Autrey.

Mark considers. “You said you could compare two buckets to check if they had the same level . . . I can see how buckets can interact with buckets. Maybe when you get a large collection of buckets, and they all have the same level, that’s what generates the magic. I’ll call that the coherentist theory of magic buckets.”

“Interesting,” says Autrey. “I know that my master is working on a system with multiple buckets—he says it might work better because of ‘redundancy’ and ‘error correction.’ That sounds like coherentism to me.”

“They’re not quite the same—” I start to say.

“Let’s test the coherentism theory of magic,” says Autrey. “I can see you’ve got five more buckets in your back pocket. I’ll hand you the bucket we’re using, and then you can fill up your other buckets to the same level—”

Mark recoils in horror. “Stop! These buckets have been passed down in my family for generations, and they’ve always had the same level! If I accept your bucket, my bucket collection will become less coherent, and the magic will go away!”

“But your current buckets don’t have anything to do with the sheep!” protests Autrey.

Mark looks exasperated. “Look, I’ve explained before, there’s obviously no way that sheep can interact with buckets. Buckets can only interact with other buckets.”

“I toss in a pebble whenever a sheep passes,” I point out.

“When a sheep passes, you toss in a pebble?” Mark says. “What does that have to do with anything?”

“It’s an interaction between the sheep and the pebbles,” I reply.

“No, it’s an interaction between the pebbles and you,” Mark says. “The magic doesn’t come from the sheep, it comes from you. Mere sheep are obviously nonmagical. The magic has to come from somewhere, on the way to the bucket.”

I point at a wooden mechanism perched on the gate. “Do you see that flap of cloth hanging down from that wooden contraption? We’re still fiddling with that—it doesn’t work reliably—but when sheep pass through, they disturb the cloth. When the cloth moves aside, a pebble drops out of a reservoir and falls into the bucket. That way, Autrey and I won’t have to toss in the pebbles ourselves.”

Mark furrows his brow. “I don’t quite follow you . . . is the cloth magical?”

I shrug. “I ordered it online from a company called Natural Selections. The fabric is called Sensory Modality.” I pause, seeing the incredulous expressions of Mark and Autrey. “I admit the names are a bit New Agey. The point is that a passing sheep triggers a chain of cause and effect that ends with a pebble in the bucket. Afterward you can compare the bucket to other buckets, and so on.”

“I still don’t get it,” Mark says. “You can’t fit a sheep into a bucket. Only pebbles go in buckets, and it’s obvious that pebbles only interact with other pebbles.”

“The sheep interact with things that interact with pebbles . . .” I search for an analogy. “Suppose you look down at your shoelaces. A photon leaves the Sun; then travels down through Earth’s atmosphere; then bounces off your shoelaces; then passes through the pupil of your eye; then strikes the retina; then is absorbed by a rod or a cone. The photon’s energy makes the attached neuron fire, which causes other neurons to fire. A neural activation pattern in your visual cortex can interact with your beliefs about your shoelaces, since beliefs about shoelaces also exist in neural substrate. If you can understand that, you should be able to see how a passing sheep causes a pebble to enter the bucket.”

“At exactly which point in the process does the pebble become magic?” says Mark.

“It . . . um . . .” Now I’m starting to get confused. I shake my head to clear away cobwebs. This all seemed simple enough when I woke up this morning, and the pebble-and-bucket system hasn’t gotten any more complicated since then. “This is a lot easier to understand if you remember that the point of the system is to keep track of sheep.”

Mark sighs sadly. “Never mind . . . it’s obvious you don’t know. Maybe all pebbles are magical to start with, even before they enter the bucket. We could call that position panpebblism.”

“Ha!” Autrey says, scorn rich in his voice. “Mere wishful thinking! Not all pebbles are created equal. The pebbles in your bucket are not magical. They’re only lumps of stone!”

Mark’s face turns stern. “Now,” he cries, “now you see the danger of the road you walk! Once you say that some people’s pebbles are magical and some are not, your pride will consume you! You will think yourself superior to all others, and so fall! Many throughout history have tortured and murdered because they thought their own pebbles supreme!” A tinge of condescension enters Mark’s voice. “Worshipping a level of pebbles as ‘magical’ implies that there’s an absolute pebble level in a Supreme Bucket. Nobody believes in a Supreme Bucket these days.”

“One,” I say. “Sheep are not absolute pebbles. Two, I don’t think my bucket actually contains the sheep. Three, I don’t worship my bucket level as perfect—I adjust it sometimes—and I do that because I care about the sheep.”

“Besides,” says Autrey, “if someone believes that possessing absolute pebbles would license torture and murder, they’re making a mistake that has nothing to do with buckets. You’re solving the wrong problem.”

Mark calms himself down. “I suppose I can’t expect any better from mere shepherds. You probably believe that snow is white, don’t you.”

“Um . . . yes?” says Autrey.

“It doesn’t bother you that Joseph Stalin believed that snow is white?”

“Um . . . no?” says Autrey.

Mark gazes incredulously at Autrey, and finally shrugs. “Let’s suppose, purely for the sake of argument, that your pebbles are magical and mine aren’t. Can you tell me what the difference is?”

“My pebbles represent the sheep!” Autrey says triumphantly. “Your pebbles don’t have the representativeness property, so they won’t work. They are empty of meaning. Just look at them. There’s 
no aura of semantic content; they are merely pebbles. You need a bucket with special causal powers.”

“Ah!” Mark says. “Special causal powers, instead of magic.”

“Exactly,” says Autrey. “I’m not superstitious. Postulating magic, in this day and age, would be unacceptable to the international shepherding community. We have found that postulating magic simply doesn’t work as an explanation for shepherding phenomena. So when I see something I don’t understand, and I want to explain it using a model with no internal detail that makes no 
predictions even in retrospect, I postulate special causal powers. Or I’ll call it an emergent phenomenon, or something.”

“What kind of special powers does the bucket have?” asks Mark.

“Hm,” says Autrey. “Maybe this bucket is imbued with an about-ness relation to the pastures. That would explain why it worked—when the bucket is empty, it means the pastures are empty.”

“Where did you find this bucket?” says Mark. “And how did you realize it had an about-ness relation to the pastures?”

“It’s an ordinary bucket,” I say. “I used to climb trees with it . . . I don’t think this question needs to be difficult.”

“I’m talking to Autrey,” says Mark.

“You have to bind the bucket to the pastures, and the pebbles to the sheep, using a magical ritual—pardon me, an emergent process with special causal powers—that my master discovered,” Autrey explains.

Autrey then attempts to describe the ritual, with Mark nodding along in sage comprehension.

“You have to throw in a pebble every time a sheep leaves through the gate?” says Mark. “Take out a pebble every time a sheep returns?”

Autrey nods. “Yeah.”

“That must be really hard,” Mark says sympathetically.

Autrey brightens, soaking up Mark’s sympathy like rain. “Exactly!” says Autrey. “It’s extremely hard on your emotions. When the bucket has held its level for a while, you . . . tend to get attached to that level.”

A sheep passes then, leaving through the gate. Autrey sees; he stoops, picks up a pebble, holds it aloft in the air. “Behold!” Autrey proclaims. “A sheep has passed! I must now toss a pebble into this bucket, my dear bucket, and destroy that fond level which has held for so long—” Another sheep passes. Autrey, caught up in his drama, misses it, so I plunk a pebble into the bucket. Autrey is still speaking: “—for that is the supreme test of the shepherd, to throw in the pebble, be it ever so agonizing, be the old level ever so precious. Indeed, only the best of shepherds can meet a requirement so stern—”

“Autrey,” I say, “if you want to be a great shepherd someday, learn to shut up and throw in the pebble. No fuss. No drama. Just do it.”

“And this ritual,” says Mark, “it binds the pebbles to the sheep by the magical laws of Sympathy and Contagion, like a voodoo doll.”

Autrey winces and looks around. “Please! Don’t call it Sympathy and Contagion. We shepherds are an anti-superstitious folk. Use the word ‘intentionality,’ or something like that.”

“Can I look at a pebble?” says Mark.

“Sure,” I say. I take one of the pebbles out of the bucket, and toss it to Mark. Then I reach to the ground, pick up another pebble, and drop it into the bucket.

Autrey looks at me, puzzled. “Didn’t you just mess it up?”

I shrug. “I don’t think so. We’ll know I messed it up if there’s a dead sheep next morning, or if we search for a few hours and don’t find any sheep.”

“But—” Autrey says.

“I taught you everything you know, but I haven’t taught you everything I know,” I say.

Mark is examining the pebble, staring at it intently. He holds his hand over the pebble and mutters a few words, then shakes his head. “I don’t sense any magical power,” he says. “Pardon me. I don’t sense any intentionality.”

“A pebble only has intentionality if it’s inside a ma—an emergent bucket,” says Autrey. “Otherwise it’s just a mere pebble.”

“Not a problem,” I say. I take a pebble out of the bucket, and toss it away. Then I walk over to where Mark stands, tap his hand holding a pebble, and say: “I declare this hand to be part of the magic bucket!” Then I resume my post at the gates.

Autrey laughs. “Now you’re just being gratuitously evil.”

I nod, for this is indeed the case.

“Is that really going to work, though?” says Autrey.

I nod again, hoping that I’m right. I’ve done this before with two buckets, and in principle, there should be no difference between Mark’s hand and a bucket. Even if Mark’s hand is imbued with the élan vital that distinguishes live matter from dead matter, the trick should work as well as if Mark were a marble statue.

Mark is looking at his hand, a bit unnerved. “So . . . the pebble has intentionality again, now?”

“Yep,” I say. “Don’t add any more pebbles to your hand, or throw away the one you have, or you’ll break the ritual.”

Mark nods solemnly. Then he resumes inspecting the pebble. “I understand now how your flocks grew so great,” Mark says. “With the power of this bucket, you could keep on tossing pebbles, and the sheep would keep returning from the fields. You could start with just a few sheep, let them leave, then fill the bucket to the brim before they returned. And if tending so many sheep grew tedious, you could let them all leave, then empty almost all the pebbles from the bucket, so that only a few returned . . . increasing the flocks again when it came time for shearing . . . dear heavens, man! Do you realize the sheer power of this ritual you’ve discovered? I can only imagine the implications; humankind might leap ahead a decade—no, a century!”

“It doesn’t work that way,” I say. “If you add a pebble when a sheep hasn’t left, or remove a pebble when a sheep hasn’t come in, that breaks the ritual. The power does not linger in the pebbles, but vanishes all at once, like a soap bubble popping.”

Mark’s face is terribly disappointed. “Are you sure?”

I nod. “I tried that and it didn’t work.”

Mark sighs heavily. “And this . . . math . . . seemed so powerful and useful until then . . . Oh, well. So much for human progress.”

“Mark, it was a brilliant idea,” Autrey says encouragingly. “The notion didn’t occur to me, and yet it’s so obvious . . . it would save an enormous amount of effort . . . there must be a way to salvage your plan! We could try different buckets, looking for one that would keep the magical pow— the intentionality in the pebbles, even without the ritual. Or try other pebbles. Maybe our pebbles just have the wrong properties to have inherent intentionality. What if we tried it using stones carved to resemble tiny sheep? Or just write ‘sheep’ on the pebbles; that might be enough.”

“Not going to work,” I predict dryly.

Autrey continues. “Maybe we need organic pebbles, instead of silicon pebbles . . . or maybe we need to use expensive gemstones. The price of gemstones doubles every eighteen months, so you could buy a handful of cheap gemstones now, and wait, and in twenty years they’d be really expensive.”

“You tried adding pebbles to create more sheep, and it didn’t work?” Mark asks me. “What exactly did you do?”

“I took a handful of dollar bills. Then I hid the dollar bills under a fold of my blanket, one by one; each time I hid another bill, I took another paperclip from a box, making a small heap. I was careful not to keep track in my head, so that all I knew was that there were ‘many’ dollar bills, and ‘many’ paperclips. Then when all the bills were hidden under my blanket, I added a single additional paperclip to the heap, the equivalent of tossing an extra pebble into the bucket. Then I started taking dollar bills from under the fold, and putting the paperclips back into the box. When I finished, a single paperclip was left over.”

“What does that result mean?” asks Autrey.

“It means the trick didn’t work. Once I broke ritual by that single misstep, the power did not linger, but vanished instantly; the heap of paperclips and the pile of dollar bills no longer went empty at the same time.”

“You actually tried this?” asks Mark.

“Yes,” I say, “I actually performed the experiment, to verify that the outcome matched my theoretical prediction. I have a sentimental fondness for the scientific method, even when it seems absurd. Besides, what if I’d been wrong?”

“If it had worked,” says Mark, “you would have been guilty of counterfeiting! Imagine if everyone did that; the economy would collapse! Everyone would have billions of dollars of currency, yet there would be nothing for money to buy!”

“Not at all,” I reply. “By that same logic whereby adding another paperclip to the heap creates another dollar bill, creating another dollar bill would create an additional dollar’s worth of goods and services.”

Mark shakes his head. “Counterfeiting is still a crime . . . You should not have tried.”

“I was reasonably confident I would fail.”

“Aha!” says Mark. “You expected to fail! You didn’t believe you could do it!”

“Indeed,” I admit. “You have guessed my expectations with stunning accuracy.”

“Well, that’s the problem,” Mark says briskly. “Magic is fueled by belief and willpower. If you don’t believe you can do it, you can’t. You need to change your belief about the experimental result, if we are to change the result itself.”

“Funny,” I say nostalgically, “that’s what Autrey said when I told him about the pebble-and-bucket method. That it was too ridiculous for him to believe, so it wouldn’t work for him.”

“How did you persuade him?” inquires Mark.

“I told him to shut up and follow instructions,” I say, “and when the method worked, Autrey started believing in it.”

Mark frowns, puzzled. “That makes no sense. It doesn’t resolve the essential chicken-and-egg dilemma.”

“Sure it does. The bucket method works whether or not you believe in it.”

“That’s absurd!” sputters Mark. “I don’t believe in magic that works whether or not you believe in it!”

“I said that too,” chimes in Autrey. “Apparently I was wrong.”

Mark screws up his face in concentration. “But . . . if you didn’t believe in magic that works whether or not you believe in it, then why did the bucket method work when you didn’t believe in it? Did you believe in magic that works whether or not you believe in it whether or not you believe in magic that works whether or not you believe in it?”

“I don’t . . . think so . . .” says Autrey doubtfully.

“Then if you didn’t believe in magic that works whether or not you . . . hold on a second, I need to work this out with paper and pencil—” Mark scribbles frantically, looks skeptically at the result, turns the piece of paper upside down, then gives up. “Never mind,” says Mark. “Magic is difficult enough for me to comprehend; metamagic is out of my depth.”

“Mark, I don’t think you understand the art of bucketcraft,” I say. “It’s not about using pebbles to control sheep. It’s about making sheep control pebbles. In this art, it is not necessary to begin by believing the art will work. Rather, first the art works, then one comes to believe that it works.”

“Or so you believe,” says Mark.

“So I believe,” I reply, “because it happens to be a fact. The correspondence between reality and my beliefs comes from reality controlling my beliefs, not the other way around.”

Another sheep passes, causing me to toss in another pebble.

“Ah! Now we come to the root of the problem,” says Mark. “What’s this so-called ‘reality’ business? I understand what it means for a hypothesis to be elegant, or falsifiable, or compatible with the evidence. It sounds to me like calling a belief ‘true’ or ‘real’ or ‘actual’ is merely the difference between saying you believe something, and saying you really really believe something.”

I pause. “Well . . .” I say slowly. “Frankly, I’m not entirely sure myself where this ‘reality’ business comes from. I can’t create my own reality in the lab, so I must not understand it yet. But occasionally I believe strongly that something is going to happen, and then something else happens instead. I need a name for whatever-it-is that determines my experimental results, so I call it ‘reality’. This ‘reality’ is somehow separate from even my very best hypotheses. Even when I have a simple hypothesis, strongly supported by all the evidence I know, sometimes I’m still surprised. So I need different names for the thingies that determine my predictions and the thingy that determines my experimental results. I call the former thingies ‘belief,’ and the latter thingy ‘reality.’ ”

Mark snorts. “I don’t even know why I bother listening to this obvious nonsense. Whatever you say about this so-called ‘reality,’ it is merely another belief. Even your belief that reality precedes your beliefs is a belief. It follows, as a logical inevitability, that reality does not exist; only beliefs exist.”

“Hold on,” says Autrey, “could you repeat that last part? You lost me with that sharp swerve there in the middle.”

“No matter what you say about reality, it’s just another belief,” explains Mark. “It follows with crushing necessity that there is no reality, only beliefs.”

“I see,” I say. “The same way that no matter what you eat, you need to eat it with your mouth. It follows that there is no food, only mouths.”

“Precisely,” says Mark. “Everything that you eat has to be in your mouth. How can there be food that exists outside your mouth? The thought is nonsense, proving that ‘food’ is an incoherent notion. That’s why we’re all starving to death; there’s no food.”

Autrey looks down at his stomach. “But I’m not starving to death.”

“Aha!” shouts Mark triumphantly. “And how did you utter that very objection? With your mouth, my friend! With your mouth! What better demonstration could you ask that there is no food?”

“What’s this about starvation?” demands a harsh, rasping voice from directly behind us. Autrey and I stay calm, having gone through this before. Mark leaps a foot in the air, startled almost out of his wits.

Inspector Darwin smiles tightly, pleased at achieving surprise, and makes a small tick on his clipboard.

“Just a metaphor!” Mark says quickly. “You don’t need to take away my mouth, or anything like that—”

“Why do you need a mouth if there is no food?” demands Darwin angrily. “Never mind. I have no time for this foolishness. I am here to inspect the sheep.”

“Flock’s thriving, sir,” I say. “No dead sheep since January.”

“Excellent. I award you 0.12 units of fitness. Now what is this person doing here? Is he a necessary part of the operations?”

“As far as I can see, he would be of more use to the human species if hung off a hot-air balloon as ballast,” I say.

“Ouch,” says Autrey mildly.

“I do not care about the human species. Let him speak for himself.”

Mark draws himself up haughtily. “This mere shepherd,” he says, gesturing at me, “has claimed that there is such a thing as reality. This offends me, for I know with deep and abiding certainty that there is no truth. The concept of ‘truth’ is merely a stratagem for people to impose their own beliefs on others. Every culture has a different ‘truth,’ and no culture’s ‘truth’ is superior to any other. This that I have said holds at all times in all places, and I insist that you agree.”

“Hold on a second,” says Autrey. “If nothing is true, why should I believe you when you say that nothing is true?”

“I didn’t say that nothing is true—” says Mark.

“Yes, you did,” interjects Autrey, “I heard you.”

“—I said that ‘truth’ is an excuse used by some cultures to enforce their beliefs on others. So when you say something is ‘true,’ you mean only that it would be advantageous to your own social group to have it believed.” 

“And this that you have said,” I say, “is it true?”

“Absolutely, positively true!” says Mark emphatically. “People create their own realities.”

“Hold on,” says Autrey, sounding puzzled again, “saying that people create their own realities is, logically, a completely separate issue from saying that there is no truth, a state of affairs I cannot even imagine coherently, perhaps because you still have not explained how exactly it is supposed to work—”

“There you go again,” says Mark exasperatedly, “trying to apply your Western concepts of logic, rationality, reason, coherence, and self-consistency.”

“Great,” mutters Autrey, “now I need to add a third subject heading, to keep track of this entirely separate and distinct claim—”

“It’s not separate,” says Mark. “Look, you’re taking the wrong attitude by treating my statements as hypotheses, and carefully deriving their consequences. You need to think of them as fully general excuses, which I apply when anyone says something I don’t like. It’s not so much a model of how the universe works, as a Get Out of Jail Free card. The key is to apply the excuse selectively. When I say that there is no such thing as truth, that applies only to your claim that the magic bucket works whether or not I believe in it. It does not apply to my claim that there is no such thing as truth.”

“Um . . . why not?” inquires Autrey.

Mark heaves a patient sigh. “Autrey, do you think you’re the first person to think of that question? To ask us how our own beliefs can be meaningful if all beliefs are meaningless? That’s the same thing many students say when they encounter this philosophy, which, I’ll have you know, has many adherents and an extensive literature.”

“So what’s the answer?” says Autrey.

“We named it the ‘reflexivity problem,’ ” explains Mark.

“But what’s the answer?” persists Autrey.

Mark smiles condescendingly. “Believe me, Autrey, you’re not the first person to think of such a simple question. There’s no point in presenting it to us as a triumphant refutation.”

“But what’s the actual answer?”

“Now, I’d like to move on to the issue of how logic kills cute baby seals—”

“You are wasting time,” snaps Inspector Darwin.

“Not to mention, losing track of sheep,” I say, tossing in another pebble.

Inspector Darwin looks at the two arguers, both apparently unwilling to give up their positions. “Listen,” Darwin says, more kindly now, “I have a simple notion for resolving your dispute. You say,” says Darwin, pointing to Mark, “that people’s beliefs alter their personal realities. And you fervently believe,” his finger swivels to point at Autrey, “that Mark’s beliefs can’t alter reality. So let Mark believe really hard that he can fly, and then step off a cliff. Mark shall see himself fly away like a bird, and Autrey shall see him plummet down and go splat, and you shall both be happy.”

We all pause, considering this.

“It sounds reasonable . . .” Mark says finally.

“There’s a cliff right there,” observes Inspector Darwin.

Autrey is wearing a look of intense concentration. Finally he shouts: “Wait! If that were true, we would all have long since departed into our own private universes, in which case the other people here are only figments of your imagination—there’s no point in trying to prove anything to us—”

A long dwindling scream comes from the nearby cliff, followed by a dull and lonely splat. Inspector Darwin flips his clipboard to the page that shows the current gene pool and pencils in a slightly lower frequency for Mark’s alleles.

Autrey looks slightly sick. “Was that really necessary?”

“Necessary?” says Inspector Darwin, sounding puzzled. “It just happened . . . I don’t quite understand your question.”

Autrey and I turn back to our bucket. It’s time to bring in the sheep. You wouldn’t want to forget about that part. Otherwise what would be the point?
