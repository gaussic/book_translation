## 聚焦你的不确定性

债券收益率会升高、降低，还是保持不变？如果你是一名电视评论员，你的工作是在事后解释结果，那就没什么可担心的。不管哪种结果发生，你都能解释为什么结果完全符合你那套市场理论。你没必要把这三种可能性看作互相排斥的对立面，因为无论发生哪种结果，你的评论都能得满分。

但等等！假设你是个新手电视评论员，还没有足够的经验能临场编出合理的解释。你需要提前为明天的节目准备发言稿，而你的准备时间有限。在这种情况下，如果你能提前知道哪种结果会发生——债券收益率会上升、下降还是保持不变——那你只需要准备一套说辞就够了。

可惜，没有人能真正预见未来。你该怎么办？你当然不能用“概率”来解决。我们都知道，学校里教的“概率”是出现在应用题旁边的小数字，而这里并没有这些小数字。更糟糕的是，你感到不确定。你不记得自己在处理应用题里的小数字时有过这种不确定感。大学里的数学课环境干净整洁，所以数学不可能适用于那些不那么整洁的现实生活场景。你可不想把思维方式不恰当地从一个情境转移到另一个情境。很明显，这不是“概率”能处理的问题。

尽管如此，你只有100分钟来准备你的说辞。你不能把全部100分钟都花在“上涨”上，同时又把全部100分钟都花在“下跌”或“持平”上。你必须想办法分配优先级。

如果你需要向评审委员会说明你的时间分配，你就得在每种可能性上花同样多的时间。因为没有写下任何小数字，你也没有文件证明自己为什么要花不同的时间。你仿佛已经听到评审们在质问：<i>“请问，芬克尔丁格先生，为什么你在第3套说辞上花了正好42分钟？为什么不是41分钟，或者43分钟？承认吧——你并不客观！你在主观偏袒！”</i>

但你突然松了口气，因为实际上并没有评审委员会来责备你。这很好，因为明天美联储有重大公告，债券价格保持不变的可能性似乎很低。你可不想在一个你根本不指望用到的说辞上浪费33分钟宝贵时间。

你的思绪总是飘回到你在电视上用过的那些解释，为什么每种事件都能合理地符合你的市场理论。但很快你就会发现，这种“合理性”在这里帮不上忙——三种结果都很合理。你的市场理论能否解释某个结果，无法指导你如何分配时间。你的100分钟时间是有限的，而你为每种结果编造解释的能力却是无限的，这两者之间有一道无法跨越的鸿沟。

然而……即使在你不确定的状态下，你似乎对这三种结果的预期并不一样；你觉得有些说辞比其他的更可能用得上。更有趣的是——当你想到某个因素让债券价格上涨的可能性更大时，你就觉得自己不太可能需要为价格下跌或持平准备说辞。

甚至你还觉得，对三种结果的预期程度，和你愿意为每种说辞花多少时间之间，似乎存在某种关系。当然，这种关系其实无法量化。你有100分钟来准备发言，但在“预期”这件事上，并没有100个什么可以分配。（不过你倒是算出来，如果某个结果真的发生了，你的效用函数会随着为该说辞准备的时间以对数方式增长。）

尽管如此……你的思绪总是回到这样一个想法：预期是有限的，和为每种结果找借口的能力不同，倒是和准备说辞的时间类似。也许预期应该被当作一种像金钱一样的有限资源。你的第一反应是想获得更多的预期，但你很快意识到，即使你有了更多的预期，你也不会有更多时间来准备说辞。不，你唯一能做的，就是尽可能合理地分配你有限的预期资源。

你很确定在统计课上没人教过你这些。他们没教你在极度不确定时该怎么办。也没教你在没有小数字可用时该怎么办。甚至就算你试图用数字，也可能用上各种各样的数字——根本没有提示你该用哪种数学，如果你真的该用数学的话！也许你会用上一对对的数字，左边一个右边一个，叫做DS（Dexter-Sinister）……谁知道还会用什么？（不过你确实只有100分钟来准备说辞。）

要是有一种艺术，能让你聚焦自己的不确定性——把尽可能多的预期集中到最终真正会发生的结果上，那该多好！

但这种艺术该叫什么？它的规则又会是什么样的呢？

## Focus Your Uncertainty

Will bond yields go up, or down, or remain the same? If you’re a TV pundit and your job is to explain the outcome after the fact, then there’s no reason to worry. No matter which of the three possibilities comes true, you’ll be able to explain why the outcome perfectly fits your pet market theory. There’s no reason to think of these three possibilities as somehow opposed to one another, as exclusive, because you’ll get full marks for punditry no matter which outcome occurs.

But wait! Suppose you’re a novice TV pundit, and you aren’t experienced enough to make up plausible explanations on the spot. You need to prepare remarks in advance for tomorrow’s broadcast, and you have limited time to prepare. In this case, it would be helpful to know which outcome will actually occur—whether bond yields will go up, down, or remain the same— because then you would only need to prepare one set of excuses.

Alas, no one can possibly foresee the future. What are you to do? You certainly can’t use “probabilities.” We all know from school that “probabilities” are little numbers that appear next to a word problem, and there aren’t any little numbers here. Worse, you feel uncertain. You don’t remember feeling uncertain while you were manipulating the little numbers in word problems. College classes teaching math are nice clean places, so math can’t apply to life situations that aren’t nice and clean. You wouldn’t want to inappropriately transfer thinking skills from one context to another. Clearly, this is not a matter for “probabilities.”

Nonetheless, you only have 100 minutes to prepare your excuses. You can’t spend the entire 100 minutes on “up,” and also spend all 100 minutes on “down,” and also spend all 100 minutes on “same.” You’ve got to prioritize somehow.

If you needed to justify your time expenditure to a review committee, you would have to spend equal time on each possibility. Since there are no little numbers written down, you’d have no documentation to justify spending different amounts of time. You can hear the reviewers now: <i>And why, Mr. Finkledinger, did you spend exactly 42 minutes on excuse #3? Why not 41 minutes, or 43? Admit it—you’re not being objective! You’re playing subjective favorites!</i>

But, you realize with a small flash of relief, there’s no review committee to scold you. This is good, because there’s a major Federal Reserve announcement tomorrow, and it seems unlikely that bond prices will remain the same. You don’t want to spend 33 precious minutes on an excuse you don’t anticipate needing.

Your mind keeps drifting to the explanations you use on television, of why each event plausibly fits your market theory. But it rapidly becomes clear that plausibility can’t help you here—all three events are plausible. Fittability to your pet market theory doesn’t tell you how to divide your time. There’s an uncrossable gap between your 100 minutes of time, which are conserved; versus your ability to explain how an outcome fits your theory, which is unlimited.

And yet . . . even in your uncertain state of mind, it seems that you anticipate the three events differently; that you expect to need some excuses more than others. And—this is the fascinating part—when you think of something that makes it seem more likely that bond prices will go up, then you feel less likely to need an excuse for bond prices going down or remaining the same.

It even seems like there’s a relation between how much you anticipate each of the three outcomes, and how much time you want to spend preparing each excuse. Of course the relation can’t actually be quantified. You have 100 minutes to prepare your speech, but there isn’t 100 of anything to divide up in this anticipation business. (Although you do work out that, if some particular outcome occurs, then your utility function is logarithmic in time spent preparing the excuse.)

Still . . . your mind keeps coming back to the idea that anticipation is limited, unlike excusability, but like time to prepare excuses. Maybe anticipation should be treated as a conserved resource, like money. Your first impulse is to try to get more anticipation, but you soon realize that, even if you get more anticipation, you won’t have any more time to prepare your excuses. No, your only course is to allocate your limited supply of anticipation as best you can.

You’re pretty sure you weren’t taught anything like that in your statistics courses. They didn’t tell you what to do when you felt so terribly uncertain. They didn’t tell you what to do when there were no little numbers handed to you. Why, even if you tried to use numbers, you might end up using any sort of numbers at all—there’s no hint what kind of math to use, if you should be using math! Maybe you’d end up using pairs of numbers, right and left numbers, which you’d call DS for Dexter-Sinister . . . or who knows what else? (Though you do have only 100 minutes to spend preparing excuses.)

If only there were an art of focusing your uncertainty—of squeezing as much anticipation as possible into whichever outcome will actually happen!

But what could we call an art like that? And what would the rules be like?
