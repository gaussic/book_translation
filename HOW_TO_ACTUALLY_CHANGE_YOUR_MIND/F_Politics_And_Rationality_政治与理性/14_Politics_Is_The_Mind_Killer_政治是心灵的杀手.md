## 政治是心灵的杀手

一谈到政治，人们的脑子就会变得奇怪。其进化原因显而易见，甚至值得反复强调：在祖先环境中，政治关乎生死。还关乎性、财富、盟友和声誉……如今，当你争论“我们”是否应该提高最低工资时，你其实是在执行祖先环境下的适应机制——在那个环境里，站错队可能会被杀，站对队则可能杀死你痛恨的对手！

如果你想阐述科学或理性相关的观点，我的建议是：只要有可能，尽量不要选择当代政治领域。如果你的观点本身就和政治密切相关，那就谈谈法国大革命时期的路易十六吧。政治当然是我们每个人都应该应用理性的领域，但它却是学习理性或讨论理性的糟糕场所——除非所有讨论者都已经非常理性。

政治就是战争的延伸，只不过换了种方式。论据就是士兵。一旦你知道自己站在哪一边，就必须支持本方的所有论据，攻击所有看似有利于敌方的论据；否则就像在背后捅自己士兵一刀——等于资敌。哪怕是那些在科学职业生涯中能冷静权衡各方观点的人，一旦遇到蓝队或绿队立场的问题，也会瞬间变成只会喊口号的僵尸。

在人工智能领域，尤其是非单调推理领域，有一个经典问题：“所有贵格会教徒都是和平主义者。所有共和党人都不是和平主义者。尼克松既是贵格会教徒又是共和党人。那么尼克松是和平主义者吗？”

为什么要选这个例子？是为了激起读者的政治情绪，让他们无法专注于主要问题吗？还是为了让共和党人在人工智能课程中感到不受欢迎，从而劝退他们进入这个领域？<sup>1</sup>

为什么有人会选这样分散注意力的例子来说明非单调推理？大概只是因为作者实在忍不住想狠狠挖苦一下那些可恨的“绿队”吧。狠狠打击对方的感觉太爽了，就像很难抗拒一块巧克力曲奇。

但就像巧克力曲奇一样，凡是让你感到愉快的东西，并不一定对你有好处。

我并不是说我们应该完全远离政治，甚至不是说要采纳维基百科那种“中立观点”的理想。但只要有可能，还是要努力克制自己，不要去挖苦对方。如果你的话题确实和禁止在学校课程中教授进化论的努力有关，那就谈吧——但别把责任全推给整个共和党；你的读者中可能就有共和党人，他们可能觉得问题只是出在少数害群之马，而不是整个党派。就像维基百科的中立观点一样，不管你（认为）共和党是否真的有错，讨论时不涉及“颜色政治”对社区的精神成长更有益。

## Politics is the Mind-Killer

People go funny in the head when talking about politics. The evolutionary reasons for this are so obvious as to be worth belaboring: In the ancestral environment, politics was a matter of life and death. And sex, and wealth, and allies, and reputation . . . When, today, you get into an argument about whether “we” ought to raise the minimum wage, you’re executing adaptations for an ancestral environment where being on the wrong side of the argument could get you killed. Being on the right side of the argument could let you kill your hated rival!

If you want to make a point about science, or rationality, then my advice is to not choose a domain from contemporary politics if you can possibly avoid it. If your point is inherently about politics, then talk about Louis XVI during the French Revolution. Politics is an important domain to which we should individually apply our rationality—but it’s a terrible domain in which to learn rationality, or discuss rationality, unless all the discussants are already rational.

Politics is an extension of war by other means. Arguments are soldiers. Once you know which side you’re on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it’s like stabbing your soldiers in the back—providing aid and comfort to the enemy. People who would be level-headed about evenhandedly weighing all sides of an issue in their professional life as scientists, can suddenly turn into slogan-chanting zombies when there’s a Blue or Green position on an issue.

In artificial intelligence, and particularly in the domain of nonmonotonic reasoning, there’s a standard problem: “All Quakers are pacifists. All Republicans are not pacifists. Nixon is a Quaker and a Republican. Is Nixon a pacifist?”

What on Earth was the point of choosing this as an example? To rouse the political emotions of the readers and distract them from the main question? To make Republicans feel unwelcome in courses on artificial intelligence and discourage them from entering the field?<sup>1</sup>

Why would anyone pick such a distracting example to illustrate nonmonotonic reasoning? Probably because the author just couldn’t resist getting in a good, solid dig at those hated Greens. It feels so good to get in a hearty punch, y’know, it’s like trying to resist a chocolate cookie.

As with chocolate cookies, not everything that feels pleasurable is good for you.

I’m not saying that I think we should be apolitical, or even that we should adopt Wikipedia’s ideal of the Neutral Point of View. But try to resist getting in those good, solid digs if you can possibly avoid it. If your topic legitimately relates to attempts to ban evolution in school curricula, then go ahead and talk about it—but don’t blame it explicitly on the whole Republican Party; some of your readers may be Republicans, and they may feel that the problem is a few rogues, not the entire party. As with Wikipedia’s NPOV, it doesn’t matter whether (you think) the Republican Party really is at fault. It’s just better for the spiritual growth of the community to discuss the issue without invoking color politics.
