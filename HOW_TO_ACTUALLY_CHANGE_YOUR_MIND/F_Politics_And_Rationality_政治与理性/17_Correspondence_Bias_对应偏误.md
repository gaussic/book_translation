## 对应偏误

> 对应偏误是指人们倾向于根据某些行为，直接推断出一个人独特且持久的性格特质，而这些行为其实完全可以用当时的情境来解释。
> ——Gilbert 和 Malone<sup>1</sup>

我们往往过于直接地把他人的行为和他们的性格对应起来。当我们看到别人无缘无故踢自动售货机时，会觉得“这个人脾气很暴”。但当你自己踢自动售货机时，是因为公交车晚点、地铁提前、报告要迟交，现在这该死的自动售货机又连续第二天吞了你的午餐钱。你会想，换了谁在这种情况下都会踢售货机。

我们把自己的行为归因于情境，觉得自己的反应完全正常。但当别人踢售货机时，我们看不到他们背后的过往经历，只看到莫名其妙的一脚，于是觉得对方一定天生脾气暴——因为他们在没有任何挑衅的情况下发火。

但想想先验概率。世界上晚点的公交车比天生极度易怒、会偶尔自发踢售货机的变异人要多得多。其实，普通人本身就是“变异体”——如果我没记错的话，平均每个人有两到十个体细胞表达的突变。但任何一个具体的 DNA 位点被影响的概率都极低。同理，一个人的性格某一方面极端偏离平均值的概率也很低。认为别人天生就和常人不同，其实是在承担极大的不可能性。

即使人们被明确告知行为的情境原因，他们也不会合理地修正自己的判断。比如让受试者知道某个支持或反对堕胎的演讲者是被随机分配到这个立场的，受试者还是会觉得演讲者本人倾向于被分配的立场。<sup>2</sup>

用水精灵解释下雨、用“燃素”解释燃烧、用“催眠力”解释安眠药的效果，这些都很直观。现实通常涉及更复杂的机制：下雨背后是蒸发和冷凝循环，燃烧背后是氧化反应，安眠药则是和神经系统的化学作用。但机制听起来比本质复杂，难以想到，也不容易获得。因此，当有人踢售货机时，我们就觉得他有“天生踢售货机倾向”。

除非踢售货机的是我们自己——那我们就会觉得自己在那种情境下行为完全正常，换谁都会这样。事实上，我们还会高估别人和我们反应一致的概率——这就是“虚假共识效应”。喝酒的学生会大大高估其他学生喝酒的比例，而不喝酒的学生则会低估。所谓“基本归因错误”，就是我们倾向于把他人行为过度归因于性格，而对自己则相反。

要理解人们为何如此行事，首先要明白每个人都觉得自己行为正常。不要去问他们天生带着什么奇怪的变异，才会有这样的表面行为。要问的是，他们觉得自己身处什么情境。没错，人确实有性格倾向，但遗传性格的变异远远不够解释你看到的所有表面行为。

假设我给你一个有红色和绿色按钮的控制器。红色按钮能毁灭世界，绿色按钮能阻止红色按钮被按下。你会按哪个？当然是绿色。任何给出不同答案的人，大概是把问题想复杂了。<sup>3</sup>

可还是有人问我，为什么我想拯救世界。<sup>4</sup> 好像我小时候受过什么创伤似的。其实，如果你把问题看成这样，答案很明显……

也许我确实有些非主流的观点，需要解释为什么我会相信这些，而大多数人不会。但在这些信念之下，我的反应其实并不需要特殊解释。也许我也是虚假共识的受害者，也许我高估了如果别人也这样看问题，会有多少人按下绿色按钮。但我敢打赌，至少会有相当一部分人这么做。

大多数人从内心深处都觉得自己很正常。即使是你讨厌的人，做了可怕事情的人，也不是特殊的变异体。其实根本不需要什么变异。当你明白这一点时，你就不会再对人类的行为感到惊讶了。

## Correspondence Bias

> The correspondence bias is the tendency to draw inferences about a person’s unique and enduring dispositions from behaviors that can be entirely explained by the situations in which they occur.
> —Gilbert and Malone<sup>1</sup>

We tend to see far too direct a correspondence between others’ actions and personalities. When we see someone else kick a vending machine for no visible reason, we assume they are “an angry person.” But when you yourself kick the vending machine, it’s because the bus was late, the train was early, your report is overdue, and now the damned vending machine has eaten your lunch money for the second day in a row. Surely, you think to yourself, anyone would kick the vending machine, in that situation.

We attribute our own actions to our situations, seeing our behaviors as perfectly normal responses to experience. But when someone else kicks a vending machine, we don’t see their past history trailing behind them in the air. We just see the kick, for no reason we know about, and we think this must be a naturally angry person—since they lashed out without any provocation.

Yet consider the prior probabilities. There are more late buses in the world, than mutants born with unnaturally high anger levels that cause them to sometimes spontaneously kick vending machines. Now the average human is, in fact, a mutant. If I recall correctly, an average individual has two to ten somatically expressed mutations. But any given DNA location is very unlikely to be affected. Similarly, any given aspect of someone’s disposition is probably not very far from average. To suggest otherwise is to shoulder a burden of improbability.

Even when people are informed explicitly of situational causes, they don’t seem to properly discount the observed behavior. When subjects are told that a pro-abortion or anti-abortion speaker was randomly assigned to give a speech on that position, subjects still think the speakers harbor leanings in the direction randomly assigned.<sup>2</sup>

It seems quite intuitive to explain rain by water spirits; explain fire by a fire-stuff (phlogiston) escaping from burning matter; explain the soporific effect of a medication by saying that it contains a “dormitive potency.” Reality usually involves more complicated mechanisms: an evaporation and condensation cycle underlying rain, oxidizing combustion underlying fire, chemical interactions with the nervous system for soporifics. But mechanisms sound more complicated than essences; they are harder to think of, less available. So when someone kicks a vending machine, we think they have an innate vending-machine-kicking-tendency.

Unless the “someone” who kicks the machine is us—in which case we’re behaving perfectly normally, given our situations; surely anyone else would do the same. Indeed, we overestimate how likely others are to respond the same way we do—the “false consensus effect.” Drinking students considerably overestimate the fraction of fellow students who drink, but nondrinkers considerably underestimate the fraction. The “fundamental attribution error” refers to our tendency to overattribute others’ behaviors to their dispositions, while reversing this tendency for ourselves.

To understand why people act the way they do, we must first realize that everyone sees themselves as behaving normally. Don’t ask what strange, mutant disposition they were born with, which directly corresponds to their surface behavior. Rather, ask what situations people see themselves as being in. Yes, people do have dispositions—but there are not enough heritable quirks of disposition to directly account for all the surface behaviors you see.

Suppose I gave you a control with two buttons, a red button and a green button. The red button destroys the world, and the green button stops the red button from being pressed. Which button would you press? The green one. Anyone who gives a different answer is probably overcomplicating the question.<sup>3</sup>

And yet people sometimes ask me why I want to save the world.<sup>4</sup> Like I must have had a traumatic childhood or something. Really, it seems like a pretty obvious decision . . . if you see the situation in those terms.

I may have non-average views which call for explanation—why do I believe such things, when most people don’t?—but given those beliefs, my reaction doesn’t seem to call forth an exceptional explanation. Perhaps I am a victim of false consensus; perhaps I overestimate how many people would press the green button if they saw the situation in those terms. But y’know, I’d still bet there’d be at least a substantial minority.

Most people see themselves as perfectly normal, from the inside. Even people you hate, people who do terrible things, are not exceptional mutants. No mutations are required, alas. When you understand this, you are ready to stop being surprised by human events.
