## 彩票：希望的浪费

对彩票的经典批评是，购买彩票的人往往是最输不起钱的人；彩票成了金钱的黑洞，把财富从最需要它的人身上吸走。一些彩票支持者，甚至包括 Overcoming Bias 上的一些评论者，试图为购买彩票辩护，说这是一种理性的幻想消费——花一美元买一天的美好期待，幻想自己成为百万富翁。

但仔细想想这意味着什么。这意味着你用宝贵的大脑去沉浸在一个几乎为零的概率的幻想里——一条极其微小的可能性线索，而你自己对此毫无影响力。你的未来将由彩票球决定。你幻想的财富无需努力——不需要勤奋、学习、魅力，甚至不需要耐心。<sup>1</sup>

这让彩票成了另一种黑洞：情感能量的黑洞。它鼓励人们把梦想、对美好未来的希望，投注在微乎其微的概率上。如果没有彩票，也许他们会幻想去上技校、开自己的公司、在工作中升职——这些都是他们真正有可能做到的事，是能让他们渴望变得更强的希望。他们的大脑在第20次幻想美好未来时，也许会发现实现梦想的真正方法。梦想和大脑不就是用来干这个的吗？但现实中有限的希望，怎么能和“即刻暴富”的人造甜蜜前景竞争呢——不是靠把互联网创业公司带到上市，而是靠下周二的开奖？

说真的，为什么我们不能直接说买彩票很蠢？人类有时候就是会做蠢事——这其实并不是什么令人惊讶的假设。

不出所料，人脑并不会做64位浮点运算，也无法把美好期待的情感力量按0.00000001的比例缩小，而不直接放弃整个思路。不出所料，很多人并没有意识到，期望效用的数值计算本该覆盖或取代他们模糊的理财直觉，反而把计算当作和美好期待“权衡”的一个论据——而且是情感上很弱的论据，因为它只是纸上的数字，而不是对美好财富的生动想象。

这似乎足以解释彩票的流行。那为什么还有那么多人要为这种经典的自我毁灭行为辩护呢？<sup>2</sup> 克服偏见的过程需要：（1）首先注意到偏见，（2）详细分析偏见，（3）决定偏见是不好的，（4）想出解决办法，然后（5）付诸实践。可惜的是，很多人能做到第1步和第2步，却在第3步卡住了，而第3步本该是五步里最容易的。偏见就像柠檬，不是柠檬水，我们不该试图把它们变成柠檬水——而是应该直接把这些柠檬烧掉。

## Lotteries: A Waste of Hope

The classic criticism of the lottery is that the people who play are the ones who can least afford to lose; that the lottery is a sink of money, draining wealth from those who most need it. Some lottery advocates, and even some commentors on Overcoming Bias, have tried to defend lottery-ticket buying as a rational purchase of fantasy—paying a dollar for a day’s worth of pleasant anticipation, imagining yourself as a millionaire.

But consider exactly what this implies. It would mean that you’re occupying your valuable brain with a fantasy whose real probability is nearly zero—a tiny line of likelihood which you, yourself, can do nothing to realize. The lottery balls will decide your future. The fantasy is of wealth that arrives without effort—without conscientiousness, learning, charisma, or even patience.<sup>1</sup>

Which makes the lottery another kind of sink: a sink of emotional energy. It encourages people to invest their dreams, their hopes for a better future, into an infinitesimal probability. If not for the lottery, maybe they would fantasize about going to technical school, or opening their own business, or getting a promotion at work—things they might be able to actually do, hopes that would make them want to become stronger. Their dreaming brains might, in the 20th visualization of the pleasant fantasy, notice a way to really do it. Isn’t that what dreams and brains are for? But how can such reality-limited fare compete with the artificially sweetened prospect of instant wealth—not after herding a dot-com startup through to IPO, but on Tuesday?

Seriously, why can’t we just say that buying lottery tickets is stupid? Human beings are stupid, from time to time—it shouldn’t be so surprising a hypothesis.

Unsurprisingly, the human brain doesn’t do 64-bit floating-point arithmetic, and it can’t devalue the emotional force of a pleasant anticipation by a factor of 0.00000001 without dropping the line of reasoning entirely. Unsurprisingly, many people don’t realize that a numerical calculation of expected utility ought to override or replace their imprecise financial instincts, and instead treat the calculation as merely one argument to be balanced against their pleasant anticipations—an emotionally weak argument, since it’s made up of mere squiggles on paper, instead of visions of fabulous wealth.

This seems sufficient to explain the popularity of lotteries. Why do so many arguers feel impelled to defend this classic form of self-destruction?<sup>2</sup> The process of overcoming bias requires (1) first noticing the bias, (2) analyzing the bias in detail, (3) deciding that the bias is bad, (4) figuring out a workaround, and then (5) implementing it. It’s unfortunate how many people get through steps 1 and 2 and then bog down in step 3, which by rights should be the easiest of the five. Biases are lemons, not lemonade, and we shouldn’t try to make lemonade out of them—just burn those lemons down.
