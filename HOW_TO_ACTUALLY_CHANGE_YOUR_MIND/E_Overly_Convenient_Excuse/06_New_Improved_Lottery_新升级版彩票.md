## 新升级版彩票

人们还在说，彩票并不是希望的浪费，而是一项能让人购买幻想的服务——“只需花比看好莱坞明星电影少得多的钱，就能做一场成为百万富翁的白日梦。”<sup>1</sup> 有位评论者写道：“成为富人的概率为零和为 epsilon（极小值）之间有很大区别。买一张彩票能让你实现财富梦想，跨越那道鸿沟。”

其实，我想表达的观点之一正是：成为富人的概率为零和为 epsilon 之间，差别只有一个数量级的 epsilon。如果你对此有疑问，不妨让 epsilon 等于 1/谷歌普勒克斯（googolplex）。

不过，假如我们假装彩票真的能卖出 epsilon 的希望，这就启发了一个新升级版彩票的设计。新升级版彩票平均每五年开奖一次，开奖时间完全随机——比如用某种不太活跃的放射性元素的衰变来决定。你只需花一美元买一次，就能获得不只是几天的 epsilon 成为富翁的机会，而是几年的 epsilon。更妙的是，你随时都有可能暴富！任何时刻，电话都可能响起，通知你——没错，就是你——成为了百万富翁！

想想这比普通的彩票开奖要好多少，普通彩票每周只开奖几次，时间固定。假如老板突然进来让你重做方案、补货，或者安排其他烦人的工作，你可以不急着干活，而是盯着电话发呆，期待那通电话——因为在那一刻，你有 epsilon 的概率会获得大奖！即使这一分钟没中，也不用失望——下一分钟也许就会发生！

想想新升级版彩票能让你做多少更多的白日梦。你可以在商店购物时往购物车里加昂贵的商品——如果你的手机没响，没收到中奖通知，你随时可以把东西放回去，对吧？

也许新升级版彩票还能实时显示中奖概率的分布，以及某些号码被选中的概率，整体期望值符合前述的泊松分布。想想这会有多有趣！哎呀，现在中奖概率比平时高了近十倍！看，我选的42号球现在中奖概率几乎是平时的两倍！你可以把这些数据推送到人们的手机屏幕上，让大家随时打开手机就能看到自己的中奖概率。想想这会有多刺激！比对账单、做作业有趣多了！这个新梦想如此美味，甚至能和去技校、早点下班回家等希望竞争。人们可以整天盯着屏幕，什么别的梦想都不用做了！

没错，向人们提供诱人的白日梦、而这些白日梦永远不会成真，当然是一项有价值的服务。人们愿意为此付钱，这一定很有价值。否则就意味着消费者在犯错——而我们都知道这不可能发生。

然而现实中，现有政府垄断彩票，却没有提供这样简单明了的服务。为什么？因为他们想多收钱。他们希望人们每周都花钱买彩票。他们希望人们花上一百美元，只为相信中奖概率比实际高一百倍，而不是让大家盯着手机屏幕等中奖概率飙升。所以，如果你真的认为彩票是一项服务，那它显然是一项极度高价的服务——而且是向社会最贫困的人群收取的——作为公民，你有责任要求推出新升级版彩票。

## New Improved Lottery

People are still suggesting that the lottery is not a waste of hope, but a service which enables purchase of fantasy—“daydreaming about becoming a millionaire for much less money than daydreaming about hollywood stars in movies.”<sup>1</sup> One commenter wrote: “There is a big difference between zero chance of becoming wealthy, and epsilon. Buying a ticket allows your dream of riches to bridge that gap.”

Actually, one of the points I was trying to make is that between zero chance of becoming wealthy, and epsilon chance, there is an order-ofepsilon difference. If you doubt this, let epsilon equal one over googolplex.

Anyway, if we pretend that the lottery sells epsilon hope, this suggests a design for a New Improved Lottery. The New Improved Lottery pays out every five years on average, at a random time—determined, say, by the decay of a not-very-radioactive element. You buy in once, for a single dollar, and get not just a few days of epsilon chance of becoming rich, but a few years of epsilon. Not only that, your wealth could strike at any time! At any minute, the phone could ring to inform you that you, yes, you are a millionaire!

Think of how much better this would be than an ordinary lottery drawing, which only takes place at defined times, a few times per week. Let’s say the boss comes in and demands you rework a proposal, or restock inventory, or something similarly annoying. Instead of getting to work, you could turn to the phone and stare, hoping for that call—because there would be epsilon chance that, at that exact moment, you yes you would be awarded the Grand Prize! And even if it doesn’t happen this minute, why, there’s no need to be disappointed—it might happen the next minute!

Think of how many more fantasies this New Improved Lottery would enable. You could shop at the store, adding expensive items to your shopping cart—if your cellphone doesn’t ring with news of a lottery win, you could always put the items back, right?

Maybe the New Improved Lottery could even show a constantly fluctuating probability distribution over the likelihood of a win occurring, and the likelihood of particular numbers being selected, with the overall expectation working out to the aforesaid Poisson distribution. Think of how much fun that would be! Oh, goodness, right this minute the chance of a win occurring is nearly ten times higher than usual! And look, the number 42 that I selected for the Mega Ball has nearly twice the usual chance of winning! You could feed it to a display on people’s cellphones, so they could just flip open the cellphone and see their chances of winning. Think of how exciting that would be! Much more exciting than trying to balance your checkbook! Much more exciting than doing your homework! This new dream would be so much tastier that it would compete with, not only hopes of going to technical school, but even hopes of getting home from work early. People could just stay glued to the screen all day long, why, they wouldn’t need to dream about anything else!

Yep, offering people tempting daydreams that will not actually happen sure is a valuable service, all right. People are willing to pay; it must be valuable. The alternative is that consumers are making mistakes, and we all know that can’t happen.

And yet current governments, with their vile monopoly on lotteries, don’t offer this simple and obvious service. Why? Because they want to overcharge people. They want them to spend money every week. They want them to spend a hundred dollars for the thrill of believing their chance of winning is a hundred times as large, instead of being able to stare at a cellphone screen waiting for the likelihood to spike. So if you believe that the lottery is a service, it is clearly an enormously overpriced service— charged to the poorest members of society—and it is your solemn duty as a citizen to demand the New Improved Lottery instead.
