## 灰色谬误

> 世故者：“世界不是非黑即白的。没有人是纯粹的善，也没有人是纯粹的恶。一切都是灰色的。所以，没有人比别人更好。”
> 求真者：“你只知道灰色，就以为所有灰色都是同一种色调。你嘲笑二元世界的简单，却用单色世界取而代之……”
> ——马克·斯蒂格勒，《大卫的投石器》

我不知道世故者的错误有没有正式的名字，但我称之为“灰色谬误”。我们在上一篇文章中已经见过这种表现——那个人认为概率是二的七亿五千万次方分之一，依然觉得“还是有可能”。对他来说，所有概率都只是“不确定”，这意味着他可以随意忽略它们。

“月亮是绿奶酪做的”和“太阳主要由氢和氦组成”都是不确定性，但它们不是同一种不确定性。

万事皆有灰度，但有些灰色几乎接近白色，有些灰色几乎接近黑色。即使不是如此，我们也可以比较灰度，说“这个更暗”“那个更亮”。

多年前，我作为理性主义者的成长过程中，有一个奇怪的小瞬间，就是读到伊恩·M·班克斯的《游戏玩家》中的这段话，尤其是加粗的那句：

> 一个有罪的体制不承认无辜者。就像任何认为所有人非敌即友的权力机构一样，我们就是它的敌人。如果你想一想，你也会是。你思考的方式就把你归入了它的敌人。这也许不是你的错，因为 **每个社会都会把自己的某些价值观强加给在其中成长的人，但关键在于，有些社会努力最大化这种影响，有些则努力最小化。** 你来自后者，现在要向前者解释自己。你会发现搪塞比想象中难；中立大概是不可能的。你无法选择不拥有自己的政治立场；它们不是与你的其他部分分离的独立实体，而是你存在的函数。我知道，他们也知道；你最好接受这一点。

请不要愤怒地评论说，如果社会施加的价值观越少，每一代人就越需要从头开始努力。这不是我从这段话中得到的启示。

我从这段话中得到的，是一个事后看来如此显然、我本可以在一百个地方学到的道理；但正是这段话让我真正领悟了。

那就是将“量化思维”应用到诸如道德判断和自我提升等人生问题上。即使你无法让某件事从“有”变成“无”，你依然可以让它增加或减少。

这是不是太显然了，不值得一提？我认为并不显然，因为许多博主都曾评价 Overcoming Bias：“这是不可能的，没有人能完全消除偏见。”哪怕对方是专业经济学家，也很明显他们还没有真正领会量化思维在日常生活和自我提升等问题上的意义。那些我无法消除的东西，依然值得减少。

再举一个 Robin Hanson 和 Tyler Cowen 的对话为例。<sup>1</sup> Robin Hanson 说他倾向于将至少75%的权重放在经济学理论的建议上，而不是自己的直觉：“我尽量直接应用经济学理论，尽量少加个人或文化判断。”Tyler Cowen 回应道：

> 在我看来，根本不存在“直接应用经济学理论”这回事……理论总是通过我们的个人和文化滤镜来应用，除此之外别无他法。

没错，但你可以努力最小化这种影响，也可以做一些必然会放大它的事。如果你努力最小化，在很多情况下我认为称其为“直接应用”也无不可——即使在经济学领域。

“每个人都不完美。”甘地不完美，斯大林也不完美，但他们的不完美不是同一种色调。“每个人都不完美”正是用单色世界取代双色世界的典型例子。如果你说：“没有人是完美的，但有些人比其他人更接近完美”，你也许得不到掌声；但对于那些努力变得更好的人来说，你至少给了他们希望。毕竟，没有人是“完美的不完美”。

（每当有人对我说“完美主义对你有害”时，我会回答：“我觉得不完美没关系，但别不完美到让别人都看出来。”）

同样，那些说“每种科学范式都会对实验解释施加自己的假设”，然后就好像证明了科学和巫医处于同一水平的人，也是如此。每种世界观都会对观察施加某种结构，但关键在于，有些世界观努力最小化这种施加，有些则以此为荣。没有绝对的白色，但有些灰色远比其他灰色更亮，把它们都当成一个水平是愚蠢的。

如果月亮在过去几十亿年里一直绕地球运行，如果你这些年都能在夜空中看到它，并且你预期明天它还会出现在预定的位置和相位，这并不是确定无疑的。如果你指望一条隐形的龙治愈你女儿的癌症，这也不是确定无疑的。但这两种不确定性完全不是一个量级——一种是你已经用小数点后十二位的精度反复预测的事情会再次发生，另一种是你指望发生的事情违背了以往的规律。把它们都称为“信仰”，未免太不细致了。

“科学也是基于信仰，所以你看！”这种心理很奇怪。通常说这话的人还声称信仰是好事。那么为什么他们说“科学也是基于信仰！”时语气愤怒而得意，而不是当作赞美？而且从他们的角度看，这种赞美其实很危险。如果科学是“信仰”，那科学就和宗教同类，可以直接比较。如果科学是一种宗教，那它就是能治病、能揭示星辰奥秘的宗教。你大可以说：“科学的祭司能公开、可验证地把人送上月球作为信仰奇迹，而你们的祭司做不到。”你真的想这样比吗，信仰者？也许你再想想，会更愿意收回“科学也是宗教”这一说法。

这里有种奇怪的心理动力：你努力让自己的灰色变得更浅，终于变得很亮了，却有人站出来愤愤不平地说：“但它不是白色！它还是灰色！”如果有人说“这还没你想的那么亮，因为有X、Y、Z等具体问题”，那是一回事；但如果只是愤怒地说“不是白，是灰”，却不指出任何具体的黑点，那就完全不同了。

在这种情况下，我开始怀疑这是一种比平常更不完美的心理——也许有人和自己的错误做了魔鬼交易，现在拒绝承认任何改进的可能。当有人找到借口不去努力变得更好时，他们往往也拒绝承认别人可以变得更好，从此一切进步的方式都成了他们的敌人，任何声称可以前进的说法都成了对他们的冒犯。于是他们一边自豪地说“我很高兴自己是灰色的”，一边愤怒地说“你也是灰色的！”

即使没有黑与白，也有明与暗，并非所有灰色都一样。

评论者 G2 推荐了阿西莫夫的《错误的相对性》：

> 当人们认为地球是平的，他们错了。当人们认为地球是球形的，他们也错了。但如果你认为“地球是球形”这种错误和“地球是平的”一样，那你的观点比这两种都更错。

## The Fallacy of Gray

The Sophisticate: “The world isn’t black and white. No one does pure good or pure bad. It’s all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else.”

The Zetet: “Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color view . . .”

-—Marc Stiegler, David’s Sling

I don’t know if the Sophisticate’s mistake has an official name, but I call it the Fallacy of Gray. We saw it manifested in the previous essay—the one who believed that odds of two to the power of seven hundred and fifty millon to one, against, meant “there was still a chance.” All probabilities, to him, were simply “uncertain” and that meant he was licensed to ignore them if he pleased.

“The Moon is made of green cheese” and “the Sun is made of mostly hydrogen and helium” are both uncertainties, but they are not the same uncertainty.

Everything is shades of gray, but there are shades of gray so light as to be very nearly white, and shades of gray so dark as to be very nearly black. Or even if not, we can still compare shades, and say “it is darker” or “it is lighter.”

Years ago, one of the strange little formative moments in my career as a rationalist was reading this paragraph from Player of Games by Iain M. Banks, especially the sentence in bold:

A guilty system recognizes no innocents. As with any power apparatus which thinks everybody’s either for it or against it, we’re against it. You would be too, if you thought about it. The very way you think places you amongst its enemies. This might not be your fault, because **every society imposes some of its values on those raised within it, but the point is that some societies try to maximize that effect, and some try to minimize it.** You come from one of the latter and you’re being asked to explain yourself to one of the former. Prevarication will be more difficult than you might imagine; neutrality is probably impossible. You cannot choose not to have the politics you do; they are not some separate set of entities somehow detachable from the rest of your being; they are a function of your existence. I know that and they know that; you had better accept it.

Now, don’t write angry comments saying that, if societies impose fewer of their values, then each succeeding generation has more work to start over from scratch. That’s not what I got out of the paragraph.

What I got out of the paragraph was something which seems so obvious in retrospect that I could have conceivably picked it up in a hundred places; but something about that one paragraph made it click for me.

It was the whole notion of the Quantitative Way applied to life-problems like moral judgments and the quest for personal self-improvement. That, even if you couldn’t switch something from on to off, you could still tend to increase it or decrease it.

Is this too obvious to be worth mentioning? I say it is not too obvious, for many bloggers have said of Overcoming Bias: “It is impossible, no one can completely eliminate bias.” I don’t care if the one is a professional economist, it is clear that they have not yet grokked the Quantitative Way as it applies to everyday life and matters like personal self-improvement. That which I cannot eliminate may be well worth reducing.

Or consider an exchange between Robin Hanson and Tyler Cowen.<sup>1</sup> Robin Hanson said that he preferred to put at least 75% weight on the prescriptions of economic theory versus his intuitions: “I try to mostly just straightforwardly apply economic theory, adding little personal or cultural judgment.” Tyler Cowen replied:

In my view there is no such thing as “straightforwardly applying economic theory” . . . theories are always applied through our personal and cultural filters and there is no other way it can be.

Yes, but you can try to minimize that effect, or you can do things that are bound to increase it. And if you try to minimize it, then in many cases I don’t think it’s unreasonable to call the output “straightforward”—even in economics.

“Everyone is imperfect.” Mohandas Gandhi was imperfect and Joseph Stalin was imperfect, but they were not the same shade of imperfection. “Everyone is imperfect” is an excellent example of replacing a two-color view with a one-color view. If you say, “No one is perfect, but some people are less imperfect than others,” you may not gain applause; but for those who strive to do better, you have held out hope. No one is perfectly imperfect, after all.

(Whenever someone says to me, “Perfectionism is bad for you,” I reply: “I think it’s okay to be imperfect, but not so imperfect that other people notice.”)

Likewise the folly of those who say, “Every scientific paradigm imposes some of its assumptions on how it interprets experiments,” and then act like they’d proven science to occupy the same level with witchdoctoring. Every worldview imposes some of its structure on its observations, but the point is that there are worldviews which try to minimize that imposition, and worldviews which glory in it. There is no white, but there are shades of gray that are far lighter than others, and it is folly to treat them as if they were all on the same level.

If the Moon has orbited the Earth these past few billion years, if you have seen it in the sky these last years, and you expect to see it in its appointed place and phase tomorrow, then that is not a certainty. And if you expect an invisible dragon to heal your daughter of cancer, that too is not a certainty. But they are rather different degrees of uncertainty—this business of expecting things to happen yet again in the same way you have previously predicted to twelve decimal places, versus expecting something to happen that violates the order previously observed. Calling them both “faith” seems a little too un-narrow.

It’s a most peculiar psychology—this business of “Science is based on faith too, so there!” Typically this is said by people who claim that faith is a good thing. Then why do they say “Science is based on faith too!” in that angry-triumphal tone, rather than as a compliment? And a rather dangerous compliment to give, one would think, from their perspective. If science is based on “faith,” then science is of the same kind as religion—directly comparable. If science is a religion, it is the religion that heals the sick and reveals the secrets of the stars. It would make sense to say, “The priests of science can blatantly, publicly, verifiably walk on the Moon as a faith-based miracle, and your priests’ faith can’t do the same.” Are you sure you wish to go there, oh faithist? Perhaps, on further reflection, you would prefer to retract this whole business of “Science is a religion too!”

There’s a strange dynamic here: You try to purify your shade of gray, and you get it to a point where it’s pretty light-toned, and someone stands up and says in a deeply offended tone, “But it’s not white! It’s gray!” It’s one thing when someone says, “This isn’t as light as you think, because of specific problems X, Y , and Z.” It’s a different matter when someone says angrily “It’s not white! It’s gray!” without pointing out any specific dark spots.

In this case, I begin to suspect psychology that is more imperfect than usual—that someone may have made a devil’s bargain with their own mistakes, and now refuses to hear of any possibility of improvement. When someone finds an excuse not to try to do better, they often refuse to concede that anyone else can try to do better, and every mode of improvement is thereafter their enemy, and every claim that it is possible to move forward is an offense against them. And so they say in one breath proudly, “I’m glad to be gray,” and in the next breath angrily, “And you’re gray too!”

If there is no black and white, there is yet lighter and darker, and not all grays are the same.

The commenter G2 points us to Asimov’s “The Relativity of Wrong”:

When people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.
