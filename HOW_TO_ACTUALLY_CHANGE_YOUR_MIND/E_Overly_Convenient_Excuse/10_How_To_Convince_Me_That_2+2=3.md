## 如何说服我相信 2 + 2 = 3

在《什么是证据？》一文中我写道：<sup>1</sup>

> 这就是为什么理性主义者如此重视那句看似悖论的话：“只有在原则上你可以被说服相信相反观点时，一个信念才真正有价值。”如果无论进入你视网膜的是什么光，你的视网膜最终状态都一样，那你就是瞎子……这就是“盲信”一词的由来。如果你的信念不依赖于你所见之物，你就和被戳瞎眼睛一样彻底失明。

我承认，我也无法想象有什么“情形”能让 2 + 2 = 4 变成假命题。（当然可以重新定义符号，但那就不是“情形”了，而且你讨论的也不再是 2、4、= 或 +。）但这并不意味着我的信念是无条件的。我其实很容易想象出一种情形，会让我相信 2 + 2 = 3。

假设有一天早上我起床，拿出两个耳塞，放在床头柜上另外两个耳塞旁边，结果发现现在只有三只耳塞，而且没有任何耳塞凭空出现或消失——这和我记忆中 2 + 2 应该等于 4 的认知相矛盾。而且，当我在脑海中想象这个过程时，发现让 XX 和 XX 变成 XXXX 需要凭空多出一个 X，这和我想象的其他算术也不一致，因为 XXX 减去 XX 等于 XX，但 XXXX 减去 XX 等于 XXX。这会和我记忆中 3−2=1 的知识冲突，但如果现实和心理都确认 XXX−XX=XX，那记忆就显得荒谬了。

我还会查查计算器、谷歌，甚至翻翻我那本《一九八四》，看看温斯顿有没有写“自由就是可以说二加二等于三”。所有这些当然都会显示，整个世界都同意我当前的直观，而不同意我的记忆：2 + 2 = 3。

我会想：我怎么可能曾经那么愚蠢地相信 2 + 2 = 4？我能想到两种解释：第一，是神经系统出了故障（也许是打喷嚏导致的），让我的记忆里所有加法结果都多了 1。第二，是有人在捉弄我，比如催眠，或者我其实是个计算机模拟体。在第二种情况下，我会更倾向于认为他们篡改了我的算术记忆，而不是 2 + 2 真等于 4。无论哪种貌似合理的解释，都不会阻止我意识到自己非常非常非常困惑。<sup>3</sup>

换句话说，说服我相信 2 + 2 = 3 的证据，和现在说服我相信 2 + 2 = 4 的证据是同一种类型：物理观察、心理想象和社会共识的交叉验证。

曾经有段时间，我根本不知道 2 + 2 = 4。我之所以得出这个新信念，并不是靠随机过程——否则我的大脑就没有理由存储“2 + 2 = 4”而不是“2 + 2 = 7”。我的大脑存储的答案恰好和我把两个耳塞放在一起时的结果一致，这就需要解释，到底是什么样的纠缠让心智和现实如此奇妙地对应。

对于事实性信念，其实只有两种可能——要么这个信念是通过心智与现实纠缠的过程获得的，要么不是。如果不是，那这个信念只能靠巧合才对。对于哪怕有一点点内部复杂度的信念（比如需要超过10比特的程序来模拟），可能性空间大到几乎不可能靠巧合蒙对。<sup>4</sup>

无条件的事实和无条件的信念不是一回事。如果纠缠的证据让我相信某个事实是无条件的，这并不意味着我一直都无条件相信这个事实。

我相信 2 + 2 = 4，而且我很容易想象出一种情形会让我相信 2 + 2 = 3。也就是说，和现在让我相信 2 + 2 = 4 的情形是同一种类型。因此，我并不担心自己是盲信的受害者。<sup>5</sup>

<sup>5</sup>如果有懂贝叶斯定理的基督徒在读这段话，我能问问你，什么样的情形会让你相信伊斯兰教是真的吗？大概也是和你现在相信基督教的原因同类型的情形吧：比如你被“推”到一个穆斯林母亲的子宫里，由穆斯林父母抚养，从小被灌输“无条件相信伊斯兰教是好事”。

或者说还有别的？如果有，什么情形会让你相信伊斯兰教，或者至少不再相信基督教？你有多自信你现在用来支持自己信仰的证据和推理方式，如果你是被穆斯林家庭养大的，也足以让你放弃原本的宗教信仰？

## How to Convince Me That 2 + 2 = 3

In “What is Evidence?” I wrote:<sup>1</sup>

This is why rationalists put such a heavy premium on the paradoxical-seeming claim that a belief is only really worthwhile if you could, in principle, be persuaded to believe otherwise. If your retina ended up in the same state regardless of what light entered it, you would be blind . . . Hence the phrase, “blind faith.” If what you believe doesn’t depend on what you see, you’ve been blinded as effectively as by poking out your eyeballs.

Cihan Baran replied:<sup>2</sup>

I can not conceive of a situation that would make 2 + 2 = 4 false. Perhaps for that reason, my belief in 2 + 2 = 4 is unconditional.

I admit, I cannot conceive of a “situation” that would make 2 + 2 = 4 false. (There are redefinitions, but those are not “situations,” and then you’re no longer talking about 2, 4, =, or +.) But that doesn’t make my belief unconditional. I find it quite easy to imagine a situation which would convince me that 2 + 2 = 3.

Suppose I got up one morning, and took out two earplugs, and set them down next to two other earplugs on my nighttable, and noticed that there were now three earplugs, without any earplugs having appeared or disappeared—in contrast to my stored memory that 2 + 2 was supposed to equal 4. Moreover, when I visualized the process in my own mind, it seemed that making XX and XX come out to XXXX required an extra X to appear from nowhere, and was, moreover, inconsistent with other arithmetic I visualized, since subtracting XX from XXX left XX, but subtracting XX from XXXX left XXX. This would conflict with my stored memory that 3− 2 = 1, but memory would be absurd in the face of physical and mental confirmation that XXX− XX = XX.

I would also check a pocket calculator, Google, and perhaps my copy of 1984 where Winston writes that “Freedom is the freedom to say two plus two equals three.” All of these would naturally show that the rest of the world agreed with my current visualization, and disagreed with my memory, that 2 + 2 = 3.

How could I possibly have ever been so deluded as to believe that 2 + 2 = 4? Two explanations would come to mind: First, a neurological fault (possibly caused by a sneeze) had made all the additive sums in my stored memory go up by one. Second, someone was messing with me, by hypnosis or by my being a computer simulation. In the second case, I would think it more likely that they had messed with my arithmetic recall than that 2 + 2 actually equalled 4. Neither of these plausible-sounding explanations would prevent me from noticing that I was very, very, very confused.<sup>3</sup>

What would convince me that 2 + 2 = 3, in other words, is exactly the same kind of evidence that currently convinces me that 2 + 2 = 4: The evidential crossfire of physical observation, mental visualization, and social agreement.

There was a time when I had no idea that 2 + 2 = 4. I did not arrive at this new belief by random processes—then there would have been no particular reason for my brain to end up storing “2 + 2 = 4” instead of “2 + 2 = 7.” The fact that my brain stores an answer surprisingly similar to what happens when I lay down two earplugs alongside two earplugs, calls forth an explanation of what entanglement produces this strange mirroring of mind and reality.

There’s really only two possibilities, for a belief of fact—either the belief got there via a mind-reality entangling process, or not. If not, the belief can’t be correct except by coincidence. For beliefs with the slightest shred of internal complexity (requiring a computer program of more than 10 bits to simulate), the space of possibilities is large enough that coincidence vanishes.<sup>4</sup>

Unconditional facts are not the same as unconditional beliefs. If entangled evidence convinces me that a fact is unconditional, this doesn’t mean I always believed in the fact without need of entangled evidence.

I believe that 2 + 2 = 4, and I find it quite easy to conceive of a situation which would convince me that 2 + 2 = 3. Namely, the same sort of situation that currently convinces me that 2 + 2 = 4. Thus I do not fear that I am a victim of blind faith.<sup>5</sup>

<sup>5</sup>If there are any Christians reading this who know Bayes’s Theorem, might I inquire of you what situation would convince you of the truth of Islam? Presumably it would be the same sort of situation causally responsible for producing your current belief in Christianity: We would push you screaming out of the uterus of a Muslim woman, and have you raised by Muslim parents who continually told you that it is good to believe unconditionally in Islam.

Or is there more to it than that? If so, what situation would convince you of Islam, or at least, non-Christianity? And how confident are you that the general kinds of evidence and reasoning you appeal to would have been enough to dissuade you of your religion if you had been raised a Muslim?
