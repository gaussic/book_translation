## 你的理性与我有关

有些人回应《彩票：希望的浪费》时批评我，认为我竟敢质疑他人的选择；如果别人选择买彩票，我凭什么反对？这其实是一个更普遍问题的特例：如果别人选择相信让自己愉快的东西而不是事实，这关我什么事？我们难道不能各自决定是否在乎真相吗？

一个显而易见的反问是：“你为什么在乎我在不在乎别人是否在乎真相？”如果你的效用函数里包含了“别人效用函数里包含了别人效用函数”的负项，这本身就有点自相矛盾。但这只是个巧妙的反问，不是答案。

所以我的答案是：作为一个人，我认为关心未来、关心人类文明的未来发展，是正当且应当的。而我关心的其中一项，就是人类对真理的追求——这种追求在几代人中缓慢增强（毕竟，科学并非一直存在）。我希望在我们这一代让这种追求更进一步。这是我对未来的愿望。因为无论我们是否接受这个责任，我们都是这场大棋局上的棋手。

这就是为什么你的理性与我有关。

这是个危险的想法吗？是的，而且不仅仅是那种“有点刺激”的危险。历史上有人因为某个神职人员觉得他们“思想不正确”而被活活烧死。因为“思想不正确”就决定烧死某人——这种推理令人作呕，对吧？你肯定不希望人们这样思考，这太恶心了。那些这样想的人，我们得想办法对付他们……

我同意！我的建议是：让我们反对糟糕的观点，但不要把持有这些观点的人烧死。

我们要避免的三段论是：“我觉得苏茜说了坏话，所以苏茜应该被烧死。”有些人试图通过贴标签来避免这个三段论，认为评价苏茜说了坏话本身就是不对的。没人应该评判任何人，谁评判谁就是大罪人，应该被公开羞辱。

而我自己的三段论是：“我觉得苏茜说错了，所以我要反驳她说的话，但我不会烧死她，也不会用暴力或法律手段让她闭嘴……”

我们都是这场大棋局上的棋手；而我对未来的一个关切，就是让这场游戏公平。科学背后的反直觉思想是：事实争议应该用实验和数学来解决，而不是用暴力和命令。这一不可思议的观念可以扩展到科学之外，成为整个未来的公平竞争。你必须靠说服别人来获胜，而不能靠把别人烧死。这是理性主义的原则之一，我对此矢志不渝。

那些鼓吹相对主义或自私主义的人，在我看来其实并不真正相对或自私。如果他们真是相对主义者，就不会评判别人；如果真是自私主义者，就会专心赚钱，而不是和别人激烈争论。实际上，他们选择了“相对主义”这一阵营，其目标是在大棋局上阻止所有棋手做某些类型的判断。或者他们选择了“自私主义”阵营，其目标是让所有棋手都变得自私。然后他们按照自己的智慧，公平或不公平地参与游戏。

如果真有完全的相对主义者或自私主义者，我们是听不到他们声音的——他们保持沉默，不参与游戏。

我无法不在乎你的思考方式，因为——正如我无法不看到这个宇宙——每当一个人背离真理，人类故事的展开就会变得更黑暗一点。很多时候，这只是微小的黑暗。（并不是每次都有人因此受伤。）在你自己内心里对自己撒谎，并不会像公开撒谎或烧死别人那样给人类历史蒙上阴影。但我心中总有一部分会为此感到哀伤。只要我不试图烧死你——只是在与你的观点争论——我相信，作为人类，关心同类是正当且应当的。这也是我会一直为之辩护的立场。

## Your Rationality Is My Business

Some responses to “Lotteries: A Waste of Hope” chided me for daring to criticize others’ decisions; if someone else chooses to buy lottery tickets, who am I to disagree? This is a special case of a more general question: What business is it of mine, if someone else chooses to believe what is pleasant rather than what is true? Can’t we each choose for ourselves whether to care about the truth?

An obvious snappy comeback is: “Why do you care whether I care whether someone else cares about the truth?” It is somewhat inconsistent for your utility function to contain a negative term for anyone else’s utility function having a term for someone else’s utility function. But that is only a snappy comeback, not an answer.

So here then is my answer: I believe that it is right and proper for me, as a human being, to have an interest in the future, and what human civilization becomes in the future. One of those interests is the human pursuit of truth, which has strengthened slowly over the generations (for there was not always Science). I wish to strengthen that pursuit further, in this generation. That is a wish of mine, for the Future. For we are all of us players upon that vast gameboard, whether we accept the responsibility or not.

And that makes your rationality my business.

Is this a dangerous idea? Yes, and not just pleasantly edgy “dangerous.” People have been burned to death because some priest decided that they didn’t think the way they should. Deciding to burn people to death because they “don’t think properly”—that’s a revolting kind of reasoning, isn’t it? You wouldn’t want people to think that way, why, it’s disgusting. People who think like that, well, we’ll have to do something about them . . .

I agree! Here’s my proposal: Let’s argue against bad ideas but not set their bearers on fire.

The syllogism we desire to avoid runs: “I think Susie said a bad thing, therefore, Susie should be set on fire.” Some try to avoid the syllogism by labeling it improper to think that Susie said a bad thing. No one should judge anyone, ever; anyone who judges is committing a terrible sin, and should be publicly pilloried for it.

As for myself, I deny the therefore. My syllogism runs, “I think Susie said something wrong, therefore, I will argue against what she said, but I will not set her on fire, or try to stop her from talking by violence or regulation . . .”

We are all of us players upon that vast gameboard; and one of my interests for the Future is to make the game fair. The counterintuitive idea underlying science is that factual disagreements should be fought out with experiments and mathematics, not violence and edicts. This incredible notion can be extended beyond science, to a fair fight for the whole Future. You should have to win by convincing people, and should not be allowed to burn them. This is one of the principles of Rationality, to which I have pledged my allegiance.

People who advocate relativism or selfishness do not appear to me to be truly relativistic or selfish. If they were really relativistic, they would not judge. If they were really selfish, they would get on with making money instead of arguing passionately with others. Rather, they have chosen the side of Relativism, whose goal upon that vast gameboard is to prevent the players—all the players—from making certain kinds of judgments. Or they have chosen the side of Selfishness, whose goal is to make all players selfish. And then they play the game, fairly or unfairly according to their wisdom.

If there are any true Relativists or Selfishes, we do not hear them—they remain silent, non-players.

I cannot help but care how you think, because—as I cannot help but see the universe—each time a human being turns away from the truth, the unfolding story of humankind becomes a little darker. In many cases, it is a small darkness only. (Someone doesn’t always end up getting hurt.) Lying to yourself, in the privacy of your own thoughts, does not shadow humanity’s history so much as telling public lies or setting people on fire. Yet there is a part of me which cannot help but mourn. And so long as I don’t try to set you on fire—only argue with your ideas—I believe that it is right and proper to me, as a human, that I care about my fellow humans. That, also, is a position I defend into the Future.
