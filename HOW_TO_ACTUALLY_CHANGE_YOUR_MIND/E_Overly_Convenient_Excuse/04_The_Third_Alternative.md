## 第三种选择

“相信圣诞老人能给孩子带来奇妙感，并激励他们为了得到礼物而表现得更好。如果真相摧毁了对圣诞老人的信仰，孩子们就会失去那份奇妙感，也不会再乖乖表现。因此，尽管相信圣诞老人并不符合事实，但它是一种高尚的谎言，为了功利主义的理由应该被保留。”

这在经典逻辑中被称为“假两难”，也叫“排中谬误”或“捆绑包谬误”。即使我们接受上述论证的事实和道德前提，结论也并不成立。即便假设“圣诞老人政策”（鼓励孩子相信圣诞老人）比“什么都不做”更好，也不能说明“圣诞老人主义”是所有可能方案中最优的。还有其他政策也能给孩子带来奇妙感，比如带他们去看航天飞机发射，或者给他们看科幻小说。同样，用奖励来鼓励孩子表现好，只会让他们在大人看着时才表现好，而用表扬代替奖励则能培养无条件的好行为。

高尚的谎言通常都是捆绑包谬误；应对这种谬误的方法是，如果我们真的需要某种好处，我们可以构建第三种选择来获得它。那我们如何获得第三种选择？获得第三种选择的第一步是决定去寻找，最后一步是决定接受它。这听起来很显然，但实际上大多数人都在这两步上失败，而不是在搜索过程本身。

有些假两难确实是诚实产生的，因为更优的选择在认知上很难被发现。但制造假两难的一个常见动机，是用某个政策相较于“什么都不做”的好处来为其辩护。在这种情况下，辩护者并不想要第三种选择；找到第三种选择会让他们失去辩护理由。圣诞老人主义者最不想听到的，就是“表扬比奖励更有效”或者“太空飞船和会飞的驯鹿一样能激发孩子的想象力”。

“最优”是“良好”的敌人。如果目标真的是帮助他人，那么发现更优的选择应该值得庆祝——一旦我们找到更好的策略，就能更有效地帮助别人。但如果目标是通过声称某策略有益来为其辩护，那么第三种选择就成了敌对论据，是竞争对手。

现代认知心理学认为，决策过程其实是一个寻找备选方案的过程。在现实生活中，仅仅比较现有选项是不够的；你首先得生成这些选项。很多问题的可选方案数量巨大，因此你需要一个停止搜索的标准。比如买房时，你不可能看遍全城的每一套房子，总得在某个时刻停止搜索并做出决定。

但如果我们寻找的动机——那些我们能承认的标准——和潜意识的影响不一致怎么办？当我们自称是在进行利他主义的搜索，寻找利他政策时，如果我们发现了一个对他人有利但对自己不利的策略——我们通常不会在这里停下，而是会继续寻找。当然，我们会告诉自己是在寻找带来更大利他的策略。但如果我们发现了一个“有一定好处”且“恰好对自己很方便”的政策呢？我们会立刻停止搜索！实际上，我们甚至会抗拒任何让我们重新开始搜索的建议——也许会以“没时间”为由推脱。（但奇怪的是，我们总能腾出认知资源为当前政策找理由。）

当你发现自己在为某个政策“辩护其合理性”而不是“追求最优”，或者你只是在强调它比“什么都不做”好，而不是所有方案中最优时，请提高警惕。

假两难常被用来为一些极其“巧合”地非常方便的不道德政策辩护。比如，撒谎通常比说实话方便得多；而坚持原有信念也比更新信念方便得多。因此，“高尚的谎言”论证很受欢迎；它为已有信念提供了防御——你不会发现有人专门去计算一个最优的新“高尚谎言”；他们只会坚持自己一开始就有的谎言。最好赶紧停止搜索！

想做得更好，就要直面自问：如果我发现有比当前政策更优的选择，我会发自内心地高兴，还是会在放弃原有政策前感到一丝不舍？如果你的答案分别是“不”和“是”，那你很可能根本没认真寻找过第三种选择。

这引出了另一个值得直问自己的好问题：我有没有真正闭上眼睛花五分钟，天马行空地头脑风暴，努力想出更好的选择？一定要用计时器计时五分钟，否则你很容易只是眨眨眼就说“我已经想过了，但没有别的选择”。眨眼是个绝佳的黑洞，可以把你的责任都丢进去。建议用真正的物理时钟。

而在这些天马行空的选项中——你是不是有意避免想出一个好主意？你内心深处是不是在暗中努力，确保每个被考虑的选项都明显很糟？

令人惊讶的是，许多高尚的说谎者及其同类，明明痛苦地哀叹自己的良心，却连用计时器认真寻找五分钟替代方案都没有。有些心理搜索其实是我们暗自希望失败的；而当成功的前景让人不舒服时，人们总会抓住最早出现的借口放弃。

## The Third Alternative

“Believing in Santa Claus gives children a sense of wonder and encourages them to behave well in hope of receiving presents. If Santa-belief is destroyed by truth, the children will lose their sense of wonder and stop behaving nicely. Therefore, even though Santa-belief is false-to-fact, it is a Noble Lie whose net benefit should be preserved for utilitarian reasons.”

Classically, this is known as a false dilemma, the fallacy of the excluded middle, or the package-deal fallacy. Even if we accept the underlying factual and moral premises of the above argument, it does not carry through. Even supposing that the Santa policy (encourage children to believe in Santa Claus) is better than the null policy (do nothing), it does not follow that Santa-ism is the best of all possible alternatives. Other policies could also supply children with a sense of wonder, such as taking them to watch a Space Shuttle launch or supplying them with science fiction novels. Likewise, offering children bribes for good behavior encourages the children to behave well only when adults are watching, while praise without bribes leads to unconditional good behavior.

Noble Lies are generally package-deal fallacies; and the response to a package-deal fallacy is that if we really need the supposed gain, we can construct a Third Alternative for getting it. How can we obtain Third Alternatives? The first step in obtaining a Third Alternative is deciding to look for one, and the last step is the decision to accept it. This sounds obvious, and yet most people fail on these two steps, rather than within the search process.

Some false dilemmas arise honestly, because superior alternatives are cognitively hard to see. But one factory for false dilemmas is justifying a questionable policy by pointing to a supposed benefit over the null action. In this case, the justifier does not want a Third Alternative; finding a Third Alternative would destroy the justification. The last thing a Santa-ist wants to hear is that praise works better than bribes, or that spaceships can be as inspiring as flying reindeer.

The best is the enemy of the good. If the goal is really to help people, then a superior alternative is cause for celebration—once we find this better strategy, we can help people more effectively. But if the goal is to justify a particular strategy by claiming that it helps people, a Third Alternative is an enemy argument, a competitor.

Modern cognitive psychology views decision-making as a search for alternatives. In real life, it’s not enough to compare options; you have to generate the options in the first place. On many problems, the number of alternatives is huge, so you need a stopping criterion for the search. When you’re looking to buy a house, you can’t compare every house in the city; at some point you have to stop looking and decide.

But what about when our conscious motives for the search—the criteria we can admit to ourselves—don’t square with subconscious influences? When we are carrying out an allegedly altruistic search, a search for an altruistic policy, and we find a strategy that benefits others but disadvantages ourselves—well, we don’t stop looking there; we go on looking. Telling ourselves that we’re looking for a strategy that brings greater altruistic benefit, of course. But suppose we find a policy that has some defensible benefit, and also just happens to be personally convenient? Then we stop the search at once! In fact, we’ll probably resist any suggestion that we start looking again—pleading lack of time, perhaps. (And yet somehow, we always have cognitive resources for coming up with justifications for our current policy.)

Beware when you find yourself arguing that a policy is defensible rather than optimal; or that it has some benefit compared to the null action, rather than the best benefit of any action.

False dilemmas are often presented to justify unethical policies that are, by some vast coincidence, very convenient. Lying, for example, is often much more convenient than telling the truth; and believing whatever you started out with is more convenient than updating. Hence the popularity of arguments for Noble Lies; it serves as a defense of a pre-existing belief—one does not find Noble Liars who calculate an optimal new Noble Lie; they keep whatever lie they started with. Better stop that search fast!

To do better, ask yourself straight out: If I saw that there was a superior alternative to my current policy, would I be glad in the depths of my heart, or would I feel a tiny flash of reluctance before I let go? If the answers are “no” and “yes,” beware that you may not have searched for a Third Alternative.

Which leads into another good question to ask yourself straight out: Did I spend five minutes with my eyes closed, brainstorming wild and creative options, trying to think of a better alternative? It has to be five minutes by the clock, because otherwise you blink—close your eyes and open them again—and say, “Why, yes, I searched for alternatives, but there weren’t any.” Blinking makes a good black hole down which to dump your duties. An actual, physical clock is recommended.

And those wild and creative options—were you careful not to think of a good one? Was there a secret effort from the corner of your mind to ensure that every option considered would be obviously bad?

It’s amazing how many Noble Liars and their ilk are eager to embrace ethical violations—with all due bewailing of their agonies of conscience— when they haven’t spent even five minutes by the clock looking for an alternative. There are some mental searches that we secretly wish would fail; and when the prospect of success is uncomfortable, people take the earliest possible excuse to give up.
