## 原初的观察

罗伯特·波西格对此的表述非常精彩，所以我直接引用他的话。我不知道这个故事是否真实，但无论如何，它都是真实的。

　　他一直在为学生们无话可说而苦恼。起初他以为是懒惰，但后来发现并非如此。他们只是想不出要说什么。

　　其中有个戴着厚镜片眼镜的女孩，想写一篇关于美国的五百字作文。他已经习惯了听到这种话时的那种沮丧感，便毫不贬低地建议她把范围缩小到博兹曼。

　　交作业那天，她没有交，很沮丧。她反复尝试，但就是想不出要写什么。

　　这让他也无话可说了。沉默了一会儿，他突然给出了一个奇特的建议：“把范围缩小到博兹曼的主街。”这是灵光一现。

　　她顺从地点点头，离开了。但就在下节课前，她带着真正的焦虑回来了，这种焦虑显然已经存在很久了。她还是想不出要写什么，也不明白，如果她对整个博兹曼都无话可说，为什么只写一条街就能写出来。

　　他很生气。“你没有去看！”他说。他想起自己因为话太多而被大学开除的往事。每一个事实都对应着无数假设。你看得越多，就会发现得越多。她确实没有去看，却又不明白这一点。

　　他生气地对她说：“把范围缩小到博兹曼主街上一栋楼的正面。歌剧院。从左上角的第一块砖开始写。”

　　她那厚厚镜片后的眼睛睁大了。

　　下节课她带着困惑的表情走进来，递给他一篇五千字的作文，写的是蒙大拿州博兹曼主街上歌剧院的正面。“我坐在街对面的汉堡店里，从第一块砖开始写，然后是第二块，到第三块的时候，思路就像泉水一样涌出来，根本停不下来。他们都觉得我疯了，还一直取笑我，但这就是全部。我也不明白为什么会这样。”

　　他也不明白，但在小镇的街道上长时间散步时，他思考着这件事，得出结论：她显然被和他第一天教书时让他瘫痪的同一种障碍困住了。她之所以卡住，是因为她试图在写作中重复她已经听过的东西，就像他第一天上课时试图重复自己早已决定要说的话一样。她想不出要写博兹曼什么，是因为她回忆不出有什么值得重复的内容。她奇怪地没有意识到，她可以在写作时自己去观察、去发现，而不必首先考虑别人说过什么。把范围缩小到一块砖，打破了她的障碍，因为这让她必须进行原创和直接的观察。

## Original Seeing

Since Robert Pirsig put this very well, I’ll just copy down what he said. I don’t know if this story is based on reality or not, but either way, it’s true.

	He’d been having trouble with students who had nothing to say. At first he thought it was laziness but later it became apparent that it wasn’t. They just couldn’t think of anything to say.

	One of them, a girl with strong-lensed glasses, wanted to write a five-hundred word essay about the United States. He was used to the sinking feeling that comes from statements like this, and suggested without disparagement that she narrow it down to just Bozeman.

	When the paper came due she didn’t have it and was quite upset. She had tried and tried but she just couldn’t think of anything to say.

	It just stumped him. Now he couldn’t think of anything to say. A silence occurred, and then a peculiar answer: “Narrow it down to the main street of Bozeman.” It was a stroke of insight.

	She nodded dutifully and went out. But just before her next class she came back in real distress, tears this time, distress that had obviously been there for a long time. She still couldn’t think of anything to say, and couldn’t understand why, if she couldn’t think of anything about all of Bozeman, she should be able to think of something about just one street.

	He was furious. “You’re not looking!” he said. A memory came back of his own dismissal from the University for having too much to say. For every fact there is an infinity of hypotheses. The more you look the more you see. She really wasn’t looking and yet somehow didn’t understand this.

	He told her angrily, “Narrow it down to the front of one building on the main street of Bozeman. The Opera House. Start with the upper left-hand brick.”

	Her eyes, behind the thick-lensed glasses, opened wide.

	She came in the next class with a puzzled look and handed him a five-thousand-word essay on the front of the Opera House on the main street of Bozeman, Montana. “I sat in the hamburger stand across the street,” she said, “and started writing about the first brick, and the second brick, and then by the third brick it all started to come and I couldn’t stop. They thought I was crazy, and they kept kidding me, but here it all is. I don’t understand it.”

	Neither did he, but on long walks through the streets of town he thought about it and concluded she was evidently stopped with the same kind of blockage that had paralyzed him on his first day of teaching. She was blocked because she was trying to repeat, in her writing, things she had already heard, just as on the first day he had tried to repeat things he had already decided to say. She couldn’t think of anything to write about Bozeman because she couldn’t recall anything she had heard worth repeating. She was strangely unaware that she could look and see freshly for herself, as she wrote, without primary regard for what had been said before. The narrowing down to one brick destroyed the blockage because it was so obvious she had to do some original and direct seeing.
