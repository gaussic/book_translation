## 暂缓提出解决方案

摘自 Robyn Dawes 的《不确定世界中的理性选择》。<sup>1</sup> 加粗为作者所加。

　　Norman R. F. Maier 指出，当一个小组面临问题时，成员们的自然倾向是刚开始讨论问题时就提出可能的解决方案。结果，小组互动会集中在这些方案的优缺点上，人们会对自己提出的方案产生情感依附，更优的方案反而不会被提出。为此，Maier 制定了一条提升小组问题解决能力的规定：“在没有尽可能彻底地讨论问题本身之前，不要提出任何解决方案。”很容易证明，在那些客观上有好方案的问题情境下，这条规定是有效的。

　　Maier 设计了如下“角色扮演”实验来证明他的观点。三名能力不同的员工在装配线上工作，他们轮流做三项需要不同能力的工作，因为最有能力、也最有主导力的员工极力避免无聊。相比之下，最不称职的员工知道自己做难的工作不如另外两人好，但因为同事的主导地位，也同意了轮岗。一位“效率专家”指出，如果让最有能力的员工做最难的工作，最不称职的员工做最简单的工作，生产效率可以提升20%，于是建议员工们停止轮岗。三名员工和……一名被指定为工头的第四人被要求讨论专家的建议。有些小组被告知 Maier 的规定：在充分讨论问题本身前不要讨论解决方案；而另一些小组则没有这个规定。没有规定的小组会立刻开始争论生产效率与员工自主权、避免无聊哪个更重要。有规定的小组则更有可能得出这样的方案：两名能力较强的员工轮岗，最不称职的员工一直做最简单的工作——这种方案能带来19%的效率提升。

　　我经常在自己带领的小组中使用这条规定——尤其是在他们面临非常棘手的问题时，这时小组成员最容易立刻提出解决方案。虽然我没有客观标准来评判小组解决问题的质量，但 Maier 的规定似乎确实能带来更好的解决方案。

这条建议真实得让人哭笑不得。问题越难，这种现象就越严重。以人工智能为例，我遇到的很多人似乎都知道如何构建通用人工智能，却连怎么做光学字符识别或协同过滤系统（这些简单得多的问题）都不知道。至于如何构建对世界有积极影响的人工智能——也就是所谓的“友好型AI”——这个问题难到令人发指，结果大多数人十五秒内就能给出完整答案。<sup>2</sup> 拜托，省省吧。

这个问题绝不仅限于AI。物理学家会遇到很多非物理学家提出自己的物理理论，经济学家也会听到各种惊人的经济学新理论。如果你是进化生物学家，任何人都能立刻解决你领域的未解难题，通常只需假设“群体选择”就行。等等等等。

Maier 的建议呼应了“结论先行”原则：我们决策的有效性只取决于我们最初做决策时用到的证据和推理——一旦你写下了结论，再往上补充理由已经太晚了。如果你很早就做出决定，无论你之后能想出多少精彩的论据，这个决定其实都只基于很少的思考。

再想想，我们改变主意的频率其实远低于自己以为：24个人平均给自己更可能选择的选项分配了66%的概率，但最终只有1人选择了自己最初认为不太可能的选项。只要你能猜到自己会选什么，基本上你已经做出决定了。如果你在听到问题半秒后就能猜到自己的答案，那你只有半秒钟的时间可以用来“聪明”地思考。这时间实在太短了。

传统理性主义强调证伪——当有明确反对证据时，能放弃最初的观点。但一旦某个想法进入你的脑海，通常需要极其强大的证据才能把它赶出去。更糟的是，我们并不总有压倒性的证据。

我怀疑，更强大（也更难做到）的方法是：暂缓思考答案。延长、拉长那一小段我们还无法猜到自己答案的时刻，让我们的智能有更长的时间发挥作用。

哪怕能多出半分钟，也比半秒钟强多了。

## Hold Off On Proposing Solutions

From Robyn Dawes’s Rational Choice in an Uncertain World.<sup>1</sup> Bolding added.

	Norman R. F. Maier noted that when a group faces a problem, the natural tendency of its members is to propose possible solutions as they begin to discuss the problem. Consequently, the group interaction focuses on the merits and problems of the proposed solutions, people become emotionally attached to the ones they have suggested, and superior solutions are not suggested. Maier enacted an edict to enhance group problem solving: “Do not propose solutions until the problem has been discussed as thoroughly as possible without suggesting any.” It is easy to show that this edict works in contexts where there are objectively defined good solutions to problems.

	Maier devised the following “role playing” experiment to demonstrate his point. Three employees of differing ability work on an assembly line. They rotate among three jobs that require different levels of ability, because the most able—who is also the most dominant—is strongly motivated to avoid boredom. In contrast, the least able worker, aware that he does not perform the more difficult jobs as well as the other two, has agreed to rotation because of the dominance of his able co-worker. An “efficiency expert” notes that if the most able employee were given the most difficult task and the least able the least difficult, productivity could be improved by 20%, and the expert recommends that the employees stop rotating. The three employees and . . . a fourth person designated to play the role of foreman are asked to discuss the expert’s recommendation. Some roleplaying groups are given Maier’s edict not to discuss solutions until having discussed the problem thoroughly, while others are not. Those who are not given the edict immediately begin to argue about the importance of productivity versus worker autonomy and the avoidance of boredom. Groups presented with the edict have a much higher probability of arriving at the solution that the two more able workers rotate, while the least able one sticks to the least demanding job—a solution that yields a 19% increase in productivity.

	I have often used this edict with groups I have led— particularly when they face a very tough problem, which is when group members are most apt to propose solutions immediately. While I have no objective criterion on which to judge the quality of the problem solving of the groups, Maier’s edict appears to foster better solutions to problems.

This is so true it’s not even funny. And it gets worse and worse the tougher the problem becomes. Take artificial intelligence, for example. A surprising number of people I meet seem to know exactly how to build an artificial general intelligence, without, say, knowing how to build an optical character recognizer or a collaborative filtering system (much easier problems). And as for building an AI with a positive impact on the world—a Friendly AI, loosely speaking—why, that problem is so incredibly difficult that an actual majority resolve the whole issue within fifteen seconds.<sup>2</sup> Give me a break.

This problem is by no means unique to AI. Physicists encounter plenty of nonphysicists with their own theories of physics, economists get to hear lots of amazing new theories of economics. If you’re an evolutionary biologist, anyone you meet can instantly solve any open problem in your field, usually by postulating group selection. Et cetera.

Maier’s advice echoes the principle of the bottom line, that the effectiveness of our decisions is determined only by whatever evidence and processing we did in first arriving at our decisions—after you write the bottom line, it is too late to write more reasons above. If you make your decision very early on, it will, in fact, be based on very little thought, no matter how many amazing arguments you come up with afterward.

And consider furthermore that we change our minds less often than we think: 24 people assigned an average 66% probability to the future choice thought more probable, but only 1 in 24 actually chose the option thought less probable. Once you can guess what your answer will be, you have probably already decided. If you can guess your answer half a second after hearing the question, then you have half a second in which to be intelligent. It’s not a lot of time.

Traditional Rationality emphasizes falsification—the ability to relinquish an initial opinion when confronted by clear evidence against it. But once an idea gets into your head, it will probably require way too much evidence to get it out again. Worse, we don’t always have the luxury of overwhelming evidence.

I suspect that a more powerful (and more difficult) method is to hold off on thinking of an answer. To suspend, draw out, that tiny moment when we can’t yet guess what our answer will be; thus giving our intelligence a longer time in which to act.

Even half a minute would be an improvement over half a second.
