## 起源谬误

在各种逻辑谬误清单中，你会看到“起源谬误”（genetic fallacy）——即根据某人相信某个观点的原因来攻击这个观点。

乍一看，这似乎很奇怪——如果一个信念的成因不能决定它的系统性可靠性，那还能靠什么？比如 Deep Blue 给我们建议下一步棋时，我们之所以信任它，是因为我们了解它的代码会搜索棋局树，而我们自己无法评估整个棋局。除了某个系统性可靠的过程产出的结果，还有什么能让概率分配“理性”呢？

关于起源谬误的文章会告诉你，起源推理并不总是谬误——证据的来源有时确实与其评估相关，比如可信专家的意见。但文章也会说，在其他情况下，这就是谬误；比如化学家凯库勒最初是在梦中看到苯的环状结构，但这并不意味着我们永远不能相信这个结论。

所以，有时候起源谬误是谬误，有时候不是？形式上说，起源谬误之所以是谬误，是因为一个信念的最初成因和它当前的正当性（即所有已知支持和反对的总和）并不相同。

然而，我们改变主意的频率远低于自己以为。在人类中，起源指控的影响力远大于理想贝叶斯主义者那里。

当你怀疑自己许多想法可能都来自一个有缺陷的来源时，“清空头脑”是一个强有力的启发式。

一旦某个想法进入我们的脑海，证据未必能轻易将其根除。想想那些从小相信《圣经》、后来（在理智层面）否定了“圣经出自上帝之手”这一观点的人，但他们依然认为《圣经》充满了不可或缺的道德智慧。他们没有清空头脑；如果他们能因为“这是《圣经》说的”而怀疑所有内容，效果会好得多。

与此同时，他们也必须牢牢记住“反向愚蠢不是智慧”这一原则；目标是真正让头脑松动，进行独立思考，而不是简单地否定《圣经》，让“反对《圣经》”成为自己的算法。

一旦某个想法进入你的脑海，你就会在所见之处到处找到它的支持——所以当最初的来源突然变得可疑时，你确实应该怀疑所有最初从那根枝条上长出来的叶子……

如果你能做到的话！清空头脑并不容易。真正重新思考，而不是让大脑陷入复述缓存论据的模式，需要极大的努力。Thor Shenkel 说过：“只有当事情真的有可能朝任意方向发展时，才算是真正的信仰危机。”

如果你发现自己有很多观点都来自一个你现在知道不可信的来源，但这些观点居然都还对——比如《圣经》，这是最典型的例子——你就应该极度怀疑。

另一方面……有些证据足够明确，以至于它最初的来源已经无关紧要。积累这种明确证据正是科学的意义所在。凯库勒最初是在梦中看到苯的环状结构，这已经无关紧要——即使我们是通过随机生成的计算机图像、一个被揭穿的灵媒，甚至是《圣经》得出的假说也无所谓。苯的环状结构已经有足够多的实验证据，最初的来源已无关紧要。

如果没有这种明确证据，那你确实需要关注观点的最初来源——比如在某个领域内，专家比外行更值得信任（如果这个领域本身值得尊重的话）；要怀疑那些你最初从可疑来源获得的观点；如果某人动机不可信，且无法给出独立于自身权威的论据，也要对其观点持怀疑态度。

当除了起源事实之外还有其他正当理由时，起源谬误就是谬误；但如果只用起源指控就想一锤定音，那就是谬误。Hal Finney 建议我们把正确地关注观点起源的做法称为“起源启发式”。<sup>1</sup>

一些适用于人类的经验法则：

- 对于你不喜欢的观点，如果有人用起源指控来攻击，尤其是当对方还给出了超越单纯权威的理由时，要保持怀疑。“飞行是宗教观念，所以莱特兄弟一定是骗子”就是经典例子之一。
- 同理，不要以为只靠分析相关人物的性格和动机就能获得技术问题的好信息。如果有技术论据，优先考虑技术论据。
- 当你对某个根本性来源产生新怀疑时，确实应该怀疑所有从那根根源长出来的枝叶。你不能直接把它们全盘否定，因为反向愚蠢不是智慧，但……
- 如果你发现自己依然相信那些后来被你否定的来源早期提出的观点，一定要极度警惕。

## The Genetic Fallacy

In lists of logical fallacies, you will find included “the genetic fallacy”—the fallacy of attacking a belief based on someone’s causes for believing it.

This is, at first sight, a very strange idea—if the causes of a belief do not determine its systematic reliability, what does? If Deep Blue advises us of a chess move, we trust it based on our understanding of the code that searches the game tree, being unable to evaluate the actual game tree ourselves. What could license any probability assignment as “rational,” except that it was produced by some systematically reliable process?

Articles on the genetic fallacy will tell you that genetic reasoning is not always a fallacy—that the origin of evidence can be relevant to its evaluation, as in the case of a trusted expert. But other times, say the articles, it is a fallacy; the chemist Kekulé first saw the ring structure of benzene in a dream, but this doesn’t mean we can never trust this belief.

So sometimes the genetic fallacy is a fallacy, and sometimes it’s not? The genetic fallacy is formally a fallacy, because the original cause of a belief is not the same as its current justificational status, the sum of all the support and antisupport currently known.

Yet we change our minds less often than we think. Genetic accusations have a force among humans that they would not have among ideal Bayesians.

Clearing your mind is a powerful heuristic when you’re faced with new suspicion that many of your ideas may have come from a flawed source.

Once an idea gets into our heads, it’s not always easy for evidence to root it out. Consider all the people out there who grew up believing in the Bible; later came to reject (on a deliberate level) the idea that the Bible was written by the hand of God; and who nonetheless think that the Bible is full of indispensable ethical wisdom. They have failed to clear their minds; they could do significantly better by doubting anything the Bible said because the Bible said it.

At the same time, they would have to bear firmly in mind the principle that reversed stupidity is not intelligence; the goal is to genuinely shake your mind loose and do independent thinking, not to negate the Bible and let that be your algorithm.

Once an idea gets into your head, you tend to find support for it everywhere you look—and so when the original source is suddenly cast into suspicion, you would be very wise indeed to suspect all the leaves that originally grew on that branch . . .

If you can! It’s not easy to clear your mind. It takes a convulsive effort to actually reconsider, instead of letting your mind fall into the pattern of rehearsing cached arguments. “It ain’t a true crisis of faith unless things could just as easily go either way,” said/ Thor Shenkel.

You should be extremely suspicious if you have many ideas suggested by a source that you now know to be untrustworthy, but by golly, it seems that all the ideas still ended up being right—the Bible being the obvious archetypal example.

On the other hand . . . there’s such a thing as sufficiently clear-cut evidence, that it no longer significantly matters where the idea originally came from. Accumulating that kind of clear-cut evidence is what Science is all about. It doesn’t matter any more that Kekulé first saw the ring structure of benzene in a dream—it wouldn’t matter if we’d found the hypothesis to test by generating random computer images, or from a spiritualist revealed as a fraud, or even from the Bible. The ring structure of benzene is pinned down by enough experimental evidence to make the source of the suggestion irrelevant.

In the absence of such clear-cut evidence, then you do need to pay attention to the original sources of ideas—to give experts more credence than layfolk, if their field has earned respect—to suspect ideas you originally got from suspicious sources—to distrust those whose motives are untrustworthy, if they cannot present arguments independent of their own authority.

The genetic fallacy is a fallacy when there exist justifications beyond the genetic fact asserted, but the genetic accusation is presented as if it settled the issue. Hal Finney suggests that we call correctly appealing to a claim’s origins “the genetic heuristic.”<sup>1</sup>

Some good rules of thumb (for humans):

- Be suspicious of genetic accusations against beliefs that you dislike, especially if the proponent claims justifications beyond the simple authority of a speaker. “Flight is a religious idea, so the Wright Brothers must be liars” is one of the classically given examples.
- By the same token, don’t think you can get good information about a technical issue just by sagely psychoanalyzing the personalities involved and their flawed motives. If technical arguments exist, they get priority.
- When new suspicion is cast on one of your fundamental sources, you really should doubt all the branches and leaves that grew from that root. You are not licensed to reject them outright as conclusions, because reversed stupidity is not intelligence, but . . .
- Be extremely suspicious if you find that you still believe the early suggestions of a source you later rejected.
