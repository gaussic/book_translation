## 锚定与调整

假设我在你面前转动一个“命运之轮”，指针停在了65。然后我问你：你认为联合国成员国中，非洲国家的比例是高于还是低于这个数字？你觉得联合国成员国中有多少百分比在非洲？你可以自己先思考一下这两个问题，请不要用谷歌查。

另外，请你在五秒内猜出下面这个算式的值。五秒钟，准备好了吗？开始！

　　1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 × 8

特沃斯基和卡尼曼记录了看到命运之轮指向不同数字的受试者的估算结果。<sup>1</sup> 看到轮盘指向65的受试者中位数估计为45%；看到轮盘指向10的受试者中位数估计为25%。

目前对这类实验的主流理论认为，受试者会把最初那个无关紧要的数字当作起点或“锚”，然后从这个起点向上或向下调整，直到得到一个“听起来合理”的答案，然后就停止调整。通常，这会导致调整幅度不足——其实更远的数字也可能“合理”，但人们会在第一个听起来还行的答案处停下。

同样，被展示“1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 × 8”的学生中位数估计为512，而被展示“8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1”的学生中位数估计为2250。背后的假设是，学生会尝试把前几个因子相乘（或猜测组合），然后再向上调整。在这两种情况下，调整幅度都远远不够，实际答案是40,320；但第一组的猜测更低，因为他们的起点锚更低。

特沃斯基和卡尼曼报告说，即使给出准确奖励，也无法减少锚定效应。

Strack 和 Mussweiler 曾让受试者猜爱因斯坦第一次访问美国是哪一年。<sup>2</sup> 即使给出完全不合理的锚点，比如1215或1992，锚定效应也和更合理的锚点（如1905或1939）一样强。

这一效应在工资谈判、买车等场景中有明显应用。我不建议你利用它，但要警惕被人利用。

也要留意自己的思维，试着觉察自己在调整数字以寻找估算值的时候。

针对锚定效应的去偏操作通常效果不佳。我建议两点：第一，如果最初的猜测听起来很不靠谱，尽量完全抛弃它，重新给出一个新估算，而不是从锚点滑过去。但即使这样也可能不够——即使被告知要避免锚定，受试者还是会受到影响。<sup>3</sup> 所以，第二，即使你在尝试第一种方法，也要试着想一个反方向的锚点——一个明显太小或太大的锚点，并短暂地思考它。

## Anchoring and Adjustment

Suppose I spin a Wheel of Fortune device as you watch, and it comes up pointing to 65. Then I ask: Do you think the percentage of countries in the United Nations that are in Africa is above or below this number? What do you think is the percentage of UN countries that are in Africa? Take a moment to consider these two questions yourself, if you like, and please don’t Google.

Also, try to guess, within five seconds, the value of the following arithmetical expression. Five seconds. Ready? Set . . . Go!

	1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 × 8

Tversky and Kahneman recorded the estimates of subjects who saw the Wheel of Fortune showing various numbers.<sup>1</sup> The median estimate of subjects who saw the wheel show 65 was 45%; the median estimate of subjects who saw 10 was 25%.

The current theory for this and similar experiments is that subjects take the initial, uninformative number as their starting point or anchor; and then they adjust upward or downward from their starting estimate until they reach an answer that “sounds plausible”; and then they stop adjusting. This typically results in under-adjustment from the anchor— more distant numbers could also be “plausible,” but one stops at the first satisfying-sounding answer.

Similarly, students shown “1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 × 8” made a median estimate of 512, while students shown “8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1” made a median estimate of 2,250. The motivating hypothesis was that students would try to multiply (or guess-combine) the first few factors of the product, then adjust upward. In both cases the adjustments were insufficient, relative to the true value of 40,320; but the first set of guesses were much more insufficient because they started from a lower anchor.

Tversky and Kahneman report that offering payoffs for accuracy did not reduce the anchoring effect.

Strack and Mussweiler asked for the year Einstein first visited the United States.<sup>2</sup> Completely implausible anchors, such as 1215 or 1992, produced anchoring effects just as large as more plausible anchors such as 1905 or 1939.

There are obvious applications in, say, salary negotiations, or buying a car. I won’t suggest that you exploit it, but watch out for exploiters.

And watch yourself thinking, and try to notice when you are adjusting a figure in search of an estimate.

Debiasing manipulations for anchoring have generally proved not very effective. I would suggest these two: First, if the initial guess sounds implausible, try to throw it away entirely and come up with a new estimate, rather than sliding from the anchor. But this in itself may not be sufficient— subjects instructed to avoid anchoring still seem to do so.<sup>3</sup> So, second, even if you are trying the first method, try also to think of an anchor in the opposite direction—an anchor that is clearly too small or too large, instead of too large or too small—and dwell on it briefly.
