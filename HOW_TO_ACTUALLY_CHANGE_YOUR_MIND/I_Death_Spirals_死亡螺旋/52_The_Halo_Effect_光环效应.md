## 光环效应

情感启发式指的是，我们对某事物整体的好恶感受会影响许多其他判断——无论这种影响是否合乎逻辑，也无论你是否意识到。比如，受试者如果被告知核能的好处，往往会认为它的风险更低；股票分析师在评价不熟悉的股票时，往往会把股票简单归为“好”或“坏”——低风险高回报，或高风险低回报——这与经济学理论（风险和回报应正相关）相悖。

光环效应就是情感启发式在社会心理学中的表现。Robert Cialdini 总结道：<sup>1</sup>

　　研究表明，我们会自动把诸如才华、善良、诚实和聪明等积极特质赋予长相好看的人（相关证据见 Eagly, Ashmore, Makhijani, and Longo, 1991）。而且，我们在做这些判断时，往往没有意识到外貌在其中起了作用。这种“好看=好人”的无意识假设带来的一些后果让我感到害怕。例如，一项对1974年加拿大联邦大选的研究发现，长相吸引人的候选人获得的选票是长相一般者的两倍半以上（Efran and Patterson, 1976）。尽管有这种偏爱帅哥政客的证据，后续研究发现选民并未意识到自己的偏见。事实上，73%的加拿大选民在调查中坚决否认自己的投票受外貌影响，只有14%的人承认有这种可能（Efran and Patterson, 1976）。选民可以否认外貌对当选的影响，但证据不断证明这种令人担忧的现象确实存在（Budesheim and DePaola, 1994）。

　　在招聘场景中也发现了类似效应。一项研究发现，在模拟面试中，求职者的仪表整洁程度对录用决定的影响甚至超过了工作资历——尽管面试官声称外貌只起了很小的作用（Mack and Rainey, 1990）。外貌优势不仅体现在录用上，还体现在薪酬上。经济学家研究美国和加拿大的数据发现，长相好看的人平均工资比外貌一般的同事高12–14%（Hamermesh and Biddle, 1994）。

　　同样令人不安的研究还表明，我们的司法系统也容易受到体型和骨骼结构的影响。现在看来，长相好看的人在法律体系中更容易获得有利待遇（相关综述见 Castellow, Wuensch, and Moore, 1991；Downs and Lyons, 1990）。例如，在宾夕法尼亚州的一项研究（Stewart, 1980）中，研究者在74名男性被告刑事审判开始时对其外貌进行了评分。很久以后，研究者查阅了这些案件的法院记录，发现长相英俊的被告判得明显更轻。事实上，长相好看的被告避免入狱的概率是长相一般者的两倍。在另一项关于过失赔偿的实验中，如果被告比受害者更好看，平均赔偿为5,623美元；而如果受害者更好看，平均赔偿为10,051美元。更有意思的是，男女陪审员都表现出这种基于外貌的偏爱（Kulka and Kessler, 1978）。

　　其他实验还发现，长相好看的人在需要帮助时更容易获得帮助（Benson, Karabenic, and Lerner, 1976），在说服观众改变观点时也更有说服力（Chaiken, 1979）……

外貌对智力、诚实或善良等评价的影响，是偏见的典型例子——尤其当你只是根据一段固定文字来判断这些品质时——因为我们没有理由认为诚实和外貌之间有任何正当的联系。另一方面，我的“聪明”印象有多少其实来自于“诚实”？我的“诚实”印象又有多少其实来自于“聪明”？发现真相和说出真相，这两者在本质上并不像“长得漂亮”和“看起来聪明”那样完全无关……

但这些关于外貌光环效应的研究，应该让我们警惕：善良或聪明等品质也可能存在类似的光环效应。假设你认识一个人，他不仅看起来很聪明，还很诚实、无私、友善、平和。你应该怀疑，这些特质中有些其实影响了你对其他特质的感知。也许这个人确实聪明、诚实、无私，但未必真的那么友善或平和。如果你发现身边的人总是分得很清楚——不是天使就是魔鬼——你也应该警惕。

还有——我知道你可能觉得没必要，但也许你真的应该——对那些更有吸引力的政治候选人，多一点怀疑。

## The Halo Effect

The affect heuristic is how an overall feeling of goodness or badness contributes to many other judgments, whether it’s logical or not, whether you’re aware of it or not. Subjects told about the benefits of nuclear power are likely to rate it as having fewer risks; stock analysts rating unfamiliar stocks judge them as generally good or generally bad—low risk and high returns, or high risk and low returns—in defiance of ordinary economic theory, which says that risk and return should correlate positively.

The halo effect is the manifestation of the affect heuristic in social psychology. Robert Cialdini summarizes:<sup>1</sup>

	Research has shown that we automatically assign to goodlooking individuals such favorable traits as talent, kindness, honesty, and intelligence (for a review of this evidence, see Eagly, Ashmore, Makhijani, and Longo, 1991). Furthermore, we make these judgments without being aware that physical attractiveness plays a role in the process. Some consequences of this unconscious assumption that “good-looking equals good” scare me. For example, a study of the 1974 Canadian federal elections found that attractive candidates received more than two and a half times as many votes as unattractive candidates (Efran and Patterson, 1976). Despite such evidence of favoritism toward handsome politicians, follow-up research demonstrated that voters did not realize their bias. In fact, 73 percent of Canadian voters surveyed denied in the strongest possible terms that their votes had been influenced by physical appearance; only 14 percent even allowed for the possibility of such influence (Efran and Patterson, 1976). Voters can deny the impact of attractiveness on electability all they want, but evidence has continued to confirm its troubling presence (Budesheim and DePaola, 1994).

	A similar effect has been found in hiring situations. In one study, good grooming of applicants in a simulated employment interview accounted for more favorable hiring decisions than did job qualifications—this, even though the interviewers claimed that appearance played a small role in their choices (Mack and Rainey, 1990). The advantage given to attractive workers extends past hiring day to payday. Economists examining US and Canadian samples have found that attractive individuals get paid an average of 12–14 percent more than their unattractive coworkers (Hamermesh and Biddle, 1994).

	Equally unsettling research indicates that our judicial process is similarly susceptible to the influences of body dimensions and bone structure. It now appears that good-looking people are likely to receive highly favorable treatment in the legal system (see Castellow, Wuensch, and Moore, 1991; and Downs and Lyons, 1990, for reviews). For example, in a Pennsylvania study (Stewart, 1980), researchers rated the physical attractiveness of 74 separate male defendants at the start of their criminal trials. When, much later, the researchers checked court records for the results of these cases, they found that the handsome men had received significantly lighter sentences. In fact, attractive defendants were twice as likely to avoid jail as unattractive defendants. In another study—this one on the damages awarded in a staged negligence trial—a defendant who was better looking than his victim was assessed an average amount of $5,623; but when the victim was the more attractive of the two, the average compensation was $10,051. What’s more, both male and female jurors exhibited the attractiveness-based favoritism (Kulka and Kessler, 1978).

	Other experiments have demonstrated that attractive people are more likely to obtain help when in need (Benson, Karabenic, and Lerner, 1976) and are more persuasive in changing the opinions of an audience (Chaiken, 1979) . . .

The influence of attractiveness on ratings of intelligence, honesty, or kindness is a clear example of bias—especially when you judge these other qualities based on fixed text—because we wouldn’t expect judgments of honesty and attractiveness to conflate for any legitimate reason. On the other hand, how much of my perceived intelligence is due to my honesty? How much of my perceived honesty is due to my intelligence? Finding the truth, and saying the truth, are not as widely separated in nature as looking pretty and looking smart . . .

But these studies on the halo effect of attractiveness should make us suspicious that there may be a similar halo effect for kindness, or intelligence. Let’s say that you know someone who not only seems very intelligent, but also honest, altruistic, kindly, and serene. You should be suspicious that some of these perceived characteristics are influencing your perception of the others. Maybe the person is genuinely intelligent, honest, and altruistic, but not all that kindly or serene. You should be suspicious if the people you know seem to separate too cleanly into devils and angels.

And—I know you don’t think you have to do it, but maybe you should—be just a little more skeptical of the more attractive political candidates.
