## 两则邪教公案

一位理性主义新手在鸥义大师门下学习，被朋友斥责道：“你整天听你师父讲‘理性’这理性那——你已经掉进邪教了！”

新手非常不安，那句“你已经掉进邪教了！”的话语在他夜里躺在床上时、甚至在梦中都萦绕耳边。

第二天，新手找到鸥义，把事情经过讲了一遍，说道：“师父，我一直担心这其实就是个邪教，你的教导只是教条。”

鸥义答道：“如果你在路上捡到一把锤子然后卖掉，无论你要价高低都无所谓。但如果你留下锤子用来钉钉子，谁还能怀疑它的价值呢？”

新手说：“你看，这正是我担心的地方——你总是用这种神秘的禅宗回答。”

鸥义说：“好吧，那我就直说，给你讲一套完全合理的论证，证明你没有掉进邪教。但首先你得戴上这顶傻帽子。”

鸥义递给新手一顶巨大的棕色十加仑牛仔帽。

“呃，师父……”新手说道。

鸥义说：“等我把一切都解释清楚，你就会明白为什么要这样做。否则，你就只能继续夜不能寐，怀疑这是不是邪教。”

新手戴上了牛仔帽。

鸥义说：“你要重复我的话到什么时候，才肯理解它们的含义？混乱的想法始于对偏好结论的执着。你太在意自己‘理性主义者’的自我形象了。你来找我是为了寻求安慰。如果你真的好奇、真的不知道答案，你会想办法解决自己的疑惑。正因为你需要消除认知失调，你才愿意戴上这顶傻帽。如果我是个恶人，完全可以让你付上一百枚银币。当你专注于现实世界的问题时，你的理解是否有用很快就会显现。你就像一个剑客，总是分心去看别人是不是在嘲笑自己——”

“好吧。”新手说道。

“是你要求听长版的。”鸥义说。

这位新手后来继承了鸥义的衣钵，被称为二之太刀。从此，他不允许学生在辩论中引用自己的话，而是说：“用技术，不要提技术。”

一位理性主义新手走到鸥义大师面前，说道：“师父，我担心我们的理性道场……呃……有点像邪教。”

“这是个严重的问题。”鸥义说道。

新手等了一会儿，鸥义却没有再说什么。

于是新手又开口道：“我是说，很抱歉，可是我们还得穿这些长袍，还有兜帽——这不就像共济会一样吗？”

“啊，”鸥义说，“长袍和装饰。”

“对，就是这些长袍和装饰。”新手说，“这看起来太不理性了。”

“我会解答你所有的疑虑，”大师说，“但首先你得戴上这顶傻帽。”说着，鸥义拿出一顶绣着新月和星星的巫师帽。

新手接过帽子，看了看，然后忍不住喊道：“这怎么可能有帮助？”

鸥义说：“既然你这么关心服饰和概率论的关系，你需要戴上特殊的帽子才能理解，这也不奇怪。”

当这位新手晋升为研究生时，他取名“Bouzo”，并且只在穿小丑服时讨论理性。

## Two Cult Koans

A novice rationalist studying under the master Ougi was rebuked by a friend who said, “You spend all this time listening to your master, and talking of ‘rational’ this and ‘rational’ that—you have fallen into a cult!”

The novice was deeply disturbed; he heard the words You have fallen into a cult! resounding in his ears as he lay in bed that night, and even in his dreams.

The next day, the novice approached Ougi and related the events, and said, “Master, I am constantly consumed by worry that this is all really a cult, and that your teachings are only dogma.”

Ougi replied, “If you find a hammer lying in the road and sell it, you may ask a low price or a high one. But if you keep the hammer and use it to drive nails, who can doubt its worth?”

The novice said, “See, now that’s just the sort of thing I worry about— your mysterious Zen replies.”

Ougi said, “Fine, then, I will speak more plainly, and lay out perfectly reasonable arguments which demonstrate that you have not fallen into a cult. But first you have to wear this silly hat.”

Ougi gave the novice a huge brown ten-gallon cowboy hat.

“Er, master . . .” said the novice.

“When I have explained everything to you,” said Ougi, “you will see why this was necessary. Or otherwise, you can continue to lie awake nights, wondering whether this is a cult.”

The novice put on the cowboy hat.

Ougi said, “How long will you repeat my words and ignore the meaning? Disordered thoughts begin as feelings of attachment to preferred conclusions. You are too anxious about your self-image as a rationalist. You came to me to seek reassurance. If you had been truly curious, not knowing one way or the other, you would have thought of ways to resolve your doubts. Because you needed to resolve your cognitive dissonance, you were willing to put on a silly hat. If I had been an evil man, I could have made you pay a hundred silver coins. When you concentrate on a real-world question, the worth or worthlessness of your understanding will soon become apparent. You are like a swordsman who keeps glancing away to see if anyone might be laughing at him—”

“All right,” said the novice.

“You asked for the long version,” said Ougi.

This novice later succeeded Ougi and became known as Ni no Tachi. Ever after, he would not allow his students to cite his words in their debates, saying, “Use the techniques and do not mention them.”

A novice rationalist approached the master Ougi and said, “Master, I worry that our rationality dojo is . . . well . . . a little cultish.”

“That is a grave concern,” said Ougi.

The novice waited a time, but Ougi said nothing more.

So the novice spoke up again: “I mean, I’m sorry, but having to wear these robes, and the hood—it just seems like we’re the bloody Freemasons or something.”

“Ah,” said Ougi, “the robes and trappings.”

“Well, yes the robes and trappings,” said the novice. “It just seems terribly irrational.”

“I will address all your concerns,” said the master, “but first you must put on this silly hat.” And Ougi drew out a wizard’s hat, embroidered with crescents and stars.

The novice took the hat, looked at it, and then burst out in frustration: “How can this possibly help?”

“Since you are so concerned about the interactions of clothing with probability theory,” Ougi said, “it should not surprise you that you must wear a special hat to understand.”

When the novice attained the rank of grad student, he took the name Bouzo and would only discuss rationality while wearing a clown suit.
