## 孤独的异见

阿希的从众实验表明，只要有一个持不同意见的人在场，“从众”错误答案的发生率就会大大降低。实验显示，只要有人和你一起反抗，个体主义就变得容易了。房间里除了你之外，所有人都说黑是白。你成为第二个说黑是黑的人。那种感觉真是无比荣耀：你们俩，孤独而倔强的反叛者，对抗整个世界！<sup>1</sup>

但你只有在某个地方有人先反抗之后，才能加入反叛。必须有人在听到所有人一个接一个地说黑是白之后，第一个站出来说黑是黑。而实验显示，这要难得多。

孤独的异见，并不像穿着黑衣去上学那样。它更像是穿着小丑服去上学。

这就是“加入反叛”和“离开群体”的区别。

有一件事我最受不了，那就是虚伪——你可能已经注意到了。而“孤独的异见”大概是最常被人假装、最张扬的特质之一。每个人都想当“反叛者”。

我并不是要贬低加入反叛的行为。有些反叛确实值得加入。要勇敢面对同龄人的不满，甚至更糟的冷漠，这确实需要勇气。当然，去听摇滚演唱会不算反叛。但比如说，素食主义就算。我自己不是素食者，但我尊重那些素食者，因为我知道，要安静地告诉别人“汉堡不适合当晚餐”，需要相当的勇气。<sup>2</sup>

不过，如果你告诉别人你是素食者，他们会觉得自己理解你的动机（即使其实并不理解）。他们可能不同意，可能会因为你太自豪地宣布而被冒犯，或者仅仅因为他们容易被冒犯。但他们知道该如何与你相处。

当有人穿着黑衣去上学时，老师和同学都明白他在社会中扮演的角色。这是“体制外”——但以一种大家都熟悉和理解的标准方式。其实并不是真的体制外。这是对标准思维的挑战，但也是标准的挑战方式，所以人们会愤愤不平地说：“我真不明白你为什么——”，但其实他们并不需要真的思考任何新东西。正如那句老话：“你读过的‘颠覆性文学’有没有真的改变过你的政治观点？”

真正需要勇气的，是面对身边人彻底的不理解，当你做的事情不是“标准反叛#37”，而是他们根本没有现成剧本应对的事情。他们不会因为你是反叛者而讨厌你。他们只是觉得你很怪，然后转身离开。这种前景带来的恐惧要深得多。这就像解释素食主义和解释人体冷冻的区别。世界上确实有其他人体冷冻支持者，但他们并不在你身边。你必须独自向那些只觉得这很怪的人解释。不是被禁止，而是超出了人们根本不会去思考的界限。你要把头冷冻起来？你觉得这样就能避免死亡？你说什么，大脑信息？啊？什么？你疯了吗？

我很想用进化心理学来事后解释一下：你可以和一小群朋友一起离开狩猎采集部落，但如果必须独自在森林中生存，那大概率等于死刑——至少在繁衍意义上是这样。我们不会把这些推理明确说出来，但进化心理学本来就不是这样运作的。加入大家都知道的反叛确实很可怕，但远没有做一件真正不同的事那么可怕——在祖先时代，这种行为的结局可能不是部落分裂，而是你被单独驱逐。

以人体冷冻为例，害怕“真正不同”的想法甚至比害怕死亡还强烈。狩猎采集者必须随时准备面对死亡——无论是狩猎大型哺乳动物，还是在充满捕食者的世界里行走。为了生存，他们需要这种勇气。而挑战部落标准思维、接受真正怪异的想法——这对持有者未必有益。我们不会把这些推理明确说出来；进化心理学不是这样运作的。我们人类天生就是这样：愿意去跳伞的人远多于愿意签人体冷冻合同的人。

而且，这还不是最高级的勇气。世界上不止一个人体冷冻支持者。只有罗伯特·艾廷格（Robert Ettinger）是第一个说出来的人。

要成为科学革命者，你必须成为第一个反驳所有你认识的人都在想的东西的人。这不是通往科学伟大的唯一道路；即使在伟人中也很罕见。没人能靠模仿“革命性”成为科学革命者。你只能通过在一切事物中追求正确答案，无论这个答案是否革命性，才能走到那一步。但如果，随着时间推移——如果你已经吸收了所有已有知识的力量和智慧——如果在这一切之后再加上一点运气，你发现自己对“正确”的追求把你带入了新领域……那时，你就有机会考验自己的勇气。

这才是真正的“孤独异见”的勇气——每一支摇滚乐队都在假装拥有的那种勇气。

当然，并不是所有需要勇气的事都是好主意。走下悬崖也需要勇气，但你只会摔成肉饼。

害怕孤独异见会阻碍好主意，但不是所有异见都是好主意。<sup>3</sup> 科学新思想最难的部分，其实在于“真”。

真的没必要为了与众不同而与众不同。只有当你看到压倒性的好理由时才选择不同，你这一生就已经够难了。

确实有一些真正的“反叛者团体”。比如“伪天主教会”（Church of the SubGenius），他们的目标似乎真的是让普通人困惑，而不仅仅是冒犯他们。世界上也有真正宽容的“孤岛”，比如科幻大会。确实有些人完全不怕离开群体。真正这样的人远比自以为是反叛者的人少得多；但他们确实存在。可科学革命者则更加罕见。请好好思考这一点。

至于我，你知道，我确实是个反叛者。每个人都觉得自己是，但我是真的。上学时我完全可以穿小丑服。我的严肃对话对象是书本，而不是其他孩子。

但如果你觉得自己也完全可以穿小丑服去上学，那也别太自豪！这只意味着你需要努力往相反方向修正，避免太容易异见。这正是我需要做的，以纠正自己的天性。别人之所以有他们的想法，是有理由的，完全无视这些理由和害怕反驳他们一样糟糕。你可不想最后变成“自由思想者”。这不是美德——只是另一种偏见而已。

## Lonely Dissent

Asch’s conformity experiment showed that the presence of a single dissenter tremendously reduced the incidence of “conforming” wrong answers. Individualism is easy, experiment shows, when you have company in your defiance. Every other subject in the room, except one, says that black is white. You become the second person to say that black is black. And it feels glorious: the two of you, lonely and defiant rebels, against the world!<sup>1</sup>

But you can only join the rebellion after someone, somewhere, becomes the first to rebel. Someone has to say that black is black after hearing everyone else, one after the other, say that black is white. And that—experiment shows—is a lot harder.

Lonely dissent doesn’t feel like going to school dressed in black. It feels like going to school wearing a clown suit.

That’s the difference between joining the rebellion and leaving the pack. 

If there’s one thing I can’t stand, it’s fakeness—you may have noticed this. Well, lonely dissent has got to be one of the most commonly, most ostentatiously faked characteristics around. Everyone wants to be an iconoclast.

I don’t mean to degrade the act of joining a rebellion. There are rebellions worth joining. It does take courage to brave the disapproval of your peer group, or perhaps even worse, their shrugs. Needless to say, going to a rock concert is not rebellion. But, for example, vegetarianism is. I’m not a vegetarian myself, but I respect people who are, because I expect it takes a noticeable amount of quiet courage to tell people that hamburgers won’t work for dinner.<sup>2</sup>

Still, if you tell people that you’re a vegetarian, they’ll think they understand your motives (even if they don’t). They may disagree. They may be offended if you manage to announce it proudly enough, or for that matter, they may be offended just because they’re easily offended. But they know how to relate to you.

When someone wears black to school, the teachers and the other children understand the role thereby being assumed in their society. It’s Outside the System—in a very standard way that everyone recognizes and understands. Not, y’know, actually outside the system. It’s a Challenge to Standard Thinking, of a standard sort, so that people indignantly say, “I can’t understand why you—” but don’t have to actually think any thoughts they had not thought before. As the saying goes, “Has any of the ‘subversive literature’ you’ve read caused you to modify any of your political views?”

What takes real courage is braving the outright incomprehension of the people around you, when you do something that isn’t Standard Rebellion #37, something for which they lack a ready-made script. They don’t hate you for a rebel. They just think you’re, like, weird, and turn away. This prospect generates a much deeper fear. It’s the difference between explaining vegetarianism and explaining cryonics. There are other cryonicists in the world, somewhere, but they aren’t there next to you. You have to explain it, alone, to people who just think it’s weird. Not forbidden, but outside bounds that people don’t even think about. You’re going to get your head frozen? You think that’s going to stop you from dying? What do you mean, brain information? Huh? What? Are you crazy?

I’m tempted to essay a post facto explanation in evolutionary psychology: You could get together with a small group of friends and walk away from your hunter-gatherer band, but having to go it alone in the forests was probably a death sentence—at least reproductively. We don’t reason this out explicitly, but that is not the nature of evolutionary psychology. Joining a rebellion that everyone knows about is scary, but nowhere near as scary as doing something really differently—something that in ancestral times might have concluded, not with the band splitting, but with you being driven out alone.

As the case of cryonics testifies, the fear of thinking really different is stronger than the fear of death. Hunter-gatherers had to be ready to face death on a routine basis—hunting large mammals, or just walking around in a world that contained predators. They needed that courage in order to live. Courage to defy the tribe’s standard ways of thinking, to entertain thoughts that seem truly weird—well, that probably didn’t serve its bearers as well. We don’t reason this out explicitly; that’s not how evolutionary psychology works. We human beings are just built in such fashion that many more of us go skydiving than sign up for cryonics.

And that’s not even the highest courage. There’s more than one cryonicist in the world. Only Robert Ettinger had to say it first.

To be a scientific revolutionary, you’ve got to be the first person to contradict what everyone else you know is thinking. This is not the only route to scientific greatness; it is rare even among the great. No one can become a scientific revolutionary by trying to imitate revolutionariness. You can only get there by pursuing the correct answer in all things, whether the correct answer is revolutionary or not. But if, in the due course of time—if, having absorbed all the power and wisdom of the knowledge that has already accumulated—if, after all that and a dose of sheer luck, you find your pursuit of mere correctness taking you into new territory . . . then you have an opportunity for your courage to fail.

This is the true courage of lonely dissent, which every damn rock band out there tries to fake.

Of course, not everything that takes courage is a good idea. It would take courage to walk off a cliff, but then you would just go splat.

The fear of lonely dissent is a hindrance to good ideas, but not every dissenting idea is good.<sup>3</sup> Most of the difficulty in having a new true scientific thought is in the “true” part.

It really isn’t necessary to be different for the sake of being different. If you do things differently only when you see an overwhelmingly good reason, you will have more than enough trouble to last you the rest of your life.

There are a few genuine packs of iconoclasts around. The Church of the SubGenius, for example, seems to genuinely aim at confusing the mundanes, not merely offending them. And there are islands of genuine tolerance in the world, such as science fiction conventions. There are certain people who have no fear of departing the pack. Many fewer such people really exist, than imagine themselves rebels; but they do exist. And yet scientific revolutionaries are tremendously rarer. Ponder that.

Now me, you know, I really am an iconoclast. Everyone thinks they are, but with me it’s true, you see. I would totally have worn a clown suit to school. My serious conversations were with books, not with other children.

But if you think you would totally wear that clown suit, then don’t be too proud of that either! It just means that you need to make an effort in the opposite direction to avoid dissenting too easily. That’s what I have to do, to correct for my own nature. Other people do have reasons for thinking what they do, and ignoring that completely is as bad as being afraid to contradict them. You wouldn’t want to end up as a free thinker. It’s not a virtue, you see—just a bias either way.
