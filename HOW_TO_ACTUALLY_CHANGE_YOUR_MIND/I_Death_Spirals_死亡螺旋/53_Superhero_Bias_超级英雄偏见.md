## 超级英雄偏见

假设有一个全副武装的反社会分子——一个绑架了人质的歹徒——他刚刚拒绝了所有谈判请求，并宣布要开始杀人。在现实生活中，当坏人手里有人质时，好人通常不会踹门而入。但有时——极其罕见，但确实有时——现实会像好莱坞电影一样，真的需要正义之士破门而入。

想象在两个截然不同的现实中，有两位英雄第一个冲进房间，直面恶棍。

在一个现实中，英雄强大到可以扔汽车，能用鼻孔发射能量波，拥有X射线听力，皮肤不仅能挡子弹，甚至能让子弹瞬间湮灭。恶棍藏身于一所小学，劫持了两百多名儿童为人质；他们的父母在外面哭泣。

在另一个现实中，英雄是一名纽约警察，人质是歹徒从街头带走的三名妓女。

请认真思考这个问题：谁才是真正更伟大的英雄？又是谁更有可能拥有属于自己的漫画书？

光环效应指的是，人们对所有正面特质的感知是相关的。外貌评分更高的人，在才华、善良、诚实和智慧等方面的评分也更高。

因此，在漫画中，那些看起来强大且刀枪不入的角色（这两点都是正面特质），也会被认为更具勇气和英雄气概。然而：

　　“当你几乎刀枪不入时，装作勇敢和无畏到底有多难？”
　　——Adam Warren，《Empowered》第1卷

我记不清下面这个观点是在哪里看到的，还是我自己猜想的：名气，尤其是名气，似乎会和其他所有人格特质叠加。想想甘地。甘地是二十世纪最无私的人，还是最有名的无私者？甘地面对过警棍和枪口。但甘地是名人，他的名气为他提供了一定程度的保护。那和他一起游行的人呢？那些即使被打进医院、被枪杀也不会上国际头条的人呢？

甘地如何看待自己获得的头条、名气、历史地位，成为非暴力抵抗的典范，而他所冒的风险其实比身边的无名英雄要小？当那些无名英雄满怀敬意地对他说“你太伟大了”时，甘地心里会怎么想？甘地是否曾以这样的视角看待自己的世界？我不知道，我不是甘地。

这绝不是对甘地的批评。非暴力抵抗的意义并不是炫耀勇气。要炫耀勇气，跳进尼亚加拉大瀑布桶里更容易。甘地无法避免因名气而获得一定保护。而且甘地的行为确实需要勇气——虽然没有匿名游行者那么多，但依然非常勇敢。

我想指出的偏见是：甘地的名气分数似乎被感知上加到了他实至名归的无私分数上。当你想到非暴力时，你想到的是甘地——而不是那些在游行中面对警棍和枪口、被打伤、终身跛行、却无人记得名字的无名抗议者。

同样，冒生命危险去救两百个孩子，和冒生命危险去救三个成年人，哪个更伟大？

答案取决于你对“伟大”的定义。如果你必须在救两百个孩子和救三个成年人之间做选择，那就选前者。“救一个人如同拯救全世界”也许很动听，但如果你必须二选一，这不是好的道德建议。所以如果你问“哪个更重要？”“哪个结果更好？”“如果只能选一个该选哪个？”那当然是救两百个更伟大。

但如果你问“伟大”在美德展现的意义上，愿意冒生命危险只为救三个人的人，比只愿意为两百人冒险却不为三人冒险的人展现了更多的勇气。

这并不意味着你可以故意选择只救三个人，让两百个孩子去死，只为了展现更大的美德。一个人如果冒险只是为了表现美德，远不如一个人冒险是为了拯救他人。有人选择救三人而不是两百人，只因为觉得这样更能展现美德，这种人对自己“伟大”的迷恋，已经在道德上等同于过失杀人。

这就是“无为而为”的场景之一：你无法通过刻意展现美德来真正展现美德。如果有一种安全的方法可以拯救世界，不需要个人牺牲或痛苦，和一种需要冒生命危险、忍受巨大痛苦的方法，你无法通过选择第二种方式成为英雄。想当英雄的欲望本身并不伟大，这样做只会迷失本意。

真正有美德、真心想救人的人，会不断努力用更少的代价救更多的人，这意味着他们展现出来的美德会更少。这也许让人困惑，但并不矛盾。

但我们并不能总是选择让自己刀枪不入。在我们已经尽力降低风险、扩大影响之后，剩下的英雄主义才是真正展现出来的美德。

那位没有超能力、没有X光视力、没有超强体力、不会飞、最重要的是没有刀枪不入的警察，冒着生命危险去救人，比超人——那个“仅仅是超级英雄”的人——展现了更大的美德。

## Superhero Bias

Suppose there’s a heavily armed sociopath, a kidnapper with hostages, who has just rejected all requests for negotiation and announced his intent to start killing. In real life, the good guys don’t usually kick down the door when the bad guy has hostages. But sometimes—very rarely, but sometimes— life imitates Hollywood to the extent of genuine good guys needing to smash through a door.

Imagine, in two widely separated realities, two heroes who charge into the room, first to confront the villain.

In one reality, the hero is strong enough to throw cars, can fire power blasts out of his nostrils, has X-ray hearing, and his skin doesn’t just deflect bullets but annihilates them on contact. The villain has ensconced himself in an elementary school and taken over two hundred children hostage; their parents are waiting outside, weeping.

In another reality, the hero is a New York police officer, and the hostages are three prostitutes the villain collected off the street.

Consider this question very carefully: Who is the greater hero? And who is more likely to get their own comic book?

The halo effect is that perceptions of all positive traits are correlated. Profiles rated higher on scales of attractiveness are also rated higher on scales of talent, kindness, honesty, and intelligence.

And so comic-book characters who seem strong and invulnerable, both positive traits, also seem to possess more of the heroic traits of courage and heroism. And yet:

	How tough can it be to act all brave and courageous when you’re pretty much invulnerable?

	—Adam Warren, Empowered, Vol. 1

I can’t remember if I read the following point somewhere, or hypothesized it myself: Fame, in particular, seems to combine additively with all other personality characteristics. Consider Gandhi. Was Gandhi the most altruistic person of the twentieth century, or just the most famous altruist? Gandhi faced police with riot sticks and soldiers with guns. But Gandhi was a celebrity, and he was protected by his celebrity. What about the others in the march, the people who faced riot sticks and guns even though there wouldn’t be international headlines if they were put in the hospital or gunned down?

What did Gandhi think of getting the headlines, the celebrity, the fame, the place in history, becoming the archetype for non-violent resistance, when he took less risk than any of the people marching with him? How did he feel when one of those anonymous heroes came up to him, eyes shining, and told Gandhi how wonderful he was? Did Gandhi ever visualize his world in those terms? I don’t know; I’m not Gandhi.

This is not in any sense a criticism of Gandhi. The point of non-violent resistance is not to show off your courage. That can be done much more easily by going over Niagara Falls in a barrel. Gandhi couldn’t help being somewhat-but-not-entirely protected by his celebrity. And Gandhi’s actions did take courage—not as much courage as marching anonymously, but still a great deal of courage.

The bias I wish to point out is that Gandhi’s fame score seems to get perceptually added to his justly accumulated altruism score. When you think about nonviolence, you think of Gandhi—not an anonymous protestor in one of Gandhi’s marches who faced down riot clubs and guns, and got beaten, and had to be taken to the hospital, and walked with a limp for the rest of her life, and no one ever remembered her name.

Similarly, which is greater—to risk your life to save two hundred children, or to risk your life to save three adults?

The answer depends on what one means by greater. If you ever have to choose between saving two hundred children and saving three adults, then choose the former. “Whoever saves a single life, it is as if he had saved the whole world” may be a fine applause light, but it’s terrible moral advice if you’ve got to pick one or the other. So if you mean “greater” in the sense of “Which is more important?” or “Which is the preferred outcome?” or “Which should I choose if I have to do one or the other?” then it is greater to save two hundred than three.

But if you ask about greatness in the sense of revealed virtue, then someone who would risk their life to save only three lives reveals more courage than someone who would risk their life to save two hundred but not three.

This doesn’t mean that you can deliberately choose to risk your life to save three adults, and let the two hundred schoolchildren go hang, because you want to reveal more virtue. Someone who risks their life because they want to be virtuous has revealed far less virtue than someone who risks their life because they want to save others. Someone who chooses to save three lives rather than two hundred lives, because they think it reveals greater virtue, is so selfishly fascinated with their own “greatness” as to have committed the moral equivalent of manslaughter.

It’s one of those wu wei scenarios: You cannot reveal virtue by trying to reveal virtue. Given a choice between a safe method to save the world which involves no personal sacrifice or discomfort, and a method that risks your life and requires you to endure great privation, you cannot become a hero by deliberately choosing the second path. There is nothing heroic about wanting to look like a hero. It would be a lost purpose.

Truly virtuous people who are genuinely trying to save lives, rather than trying to reveal virtue, will constantly seek to save more lives with less effort, which means that less of their virtue will be revealed. It may be confusing, but it’s not contradictory.

But we cannot always choose to be invulnerable to bullets. After we’ve done our best to reduce risk and increase scope, any remaining heroism is well and truly revealed.

The police officer who puts their life on the line with no superpowers, no X-Ray vision, no super-strength, no ability to fly, and above all no invulnerability to bullets, reveals far greater virtue than Superman—who is a mere superhero.
