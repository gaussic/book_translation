## 对自我欺骗的信仰

昨天我提到，曾与一位名义上的正统犹太女性交谈。她极力为自己“相信上帝”这一说法辩护，但实际上似乎根本并不真的相信上帝。

当我问她认为信仰上帝能带来哪些好处时，我向她介绍了塔尔斯基祷文——其实这是一组无限多的祷文，举个具体例子：

  _如果天空是蓝色的_  
      _我希望自己相信“天空是蓝色的”_  
  _如果天空不是蓝色的_  
      _我希望自己相信“天空不是蓝色的”_

“这不是我的哲学观。”她对我说。

“我也没觉得是，”我回答，“我只是想问——假设上帝不存在，并且这是已知的，那么你还应该相信上帝吗？”

她犹豫了。她似乎真的在努力思考这个问题，这让我很意外。

“所以这是个反事实的问题……”她慢慢地说。

当时我以为，她之所以难以设想没有上帝的世界，是因为她太执着于有上帝的世界。

但现在我怀疑，她其实难以想象“有上帝”和“没有上帝”的世界会有何不同，因为她所有的思考都围绕着“信仰上帝”，而她用来建模世界的因果网络里根本没有“上帝”这个节点。所以她很容易回答“如果我不信上帝，世界会变成什么样？”，但无法回答“如果没有上帝，世界会变成什么样？”

她当时没有回答这个问题。但她确实给出了一个塔尔斯基祷文的反例：

她说：“我相信人们比实际更善良。”

我试图解释，如果你说“人很坏”，那就表示你相信人很坏；如果你说“我相信人很善良”，那就表示你相信自己相信人很善良。所以说“人很坏但我相信人很善良”，意思就是你相信人很坏，但你相信自己相信人很善良。

我给她引用了：

  “如果有一个动词表示‘错误地相信’，它在第一人称现在时态下是没有实际意义的。”
          ——路德维希·维特根斯坦

她微笑着说：“是的，我相信人们比实际上更善良。我只是觉得这样说你会更容易理解。”

  “我觉得奶奶应该好好看看你，沃尔特，”保姆说，“我觉得你的脑子就像一团掉在地上的乱线球。”
          ——特里·普拉切特，《假面舞会》

我可以打出这样的话：“好吧，我猜她并不认为自己的推理在反思下应该自洽”，但我还是很难真正理解这一点。

我能看懂她嘴里说出的句子模式，但我无法在共情层面理解她的思维。我可以想象自己变成吃婴儿的外星人，或者第三代切嗣夫人，但我无法想象成为她是什么感觉。或者说，也许我根本不想去想？

这也是为什么聪明人只有在有限的时间内（以思考宗教的主观时间计）才有可能成为无神论者。到了一定程度，如果你很聪明、花了很多时间思考和为宗教辩护，却依然没能逃脱“黑暗面认识论”的掌控，你的内心世界最终就会变成一幅埃舍尔画。

（她为数不多的几次停顿之一——我提一下，以备你有机会用到——是她谈到“相信有人在乎你做对还是做错”是件好事时——当然，她说的并不是“真的有一个上帝在乎你做对还是做错”，这个命题并不是她宗教的一部分——

我说：“但我在乎你做对还是做错。所以你的意思是，这还不够，你还需要相信有超越人类的存在在乎你做对还是做错。”这让她愣住了一会儿，因为她以前从没这样想过。这只是非常规工具箱的标准用法。）

后来有一次，我问她，如果确定没有上帝，是否有必要做出任何不同的行为，这次她回答：“没有必要。”

“所以，”我难以置信地说，“上帝存在与否，对人们该如何思考或行动完全没有影响？我觉得连拉比都要对此皱眉吧。”

她的宗教现在似乎完全变成了对“崇拜”本身的崇拜。就像过去的真信徒相信全知的父亲会拯救他们一样，她现在相信“信仰上帝”会拯救她。

她说“我相信人们比实际更善良”后，我问：“那么，当人们达不到你的期望时，你总是会感到惊讶吗？”她沉默了很久，然后慢慢地说：“嗯……当人们……达不到我的期望时，我会感到惊讶吗？”

我当时没理解这个停顿。我本意是想暗示，如果她总是被现实所失望，那这就是错误信念的坏处。但她似乎反而被“不感到惊讶”这个含义吓了一跳。

我现在意识到，她整个哲学的核心就是“相信自己欺骗了自己”，而如果她对他人的判断其实是准确的

## Belief in Self-Deception

I spoke yesterday of my conversation with a nominally Orthodox Jewish woman who vigorously defended the assertion that she believed in God, while seeming not to actually believe in God at all.

While I was questioning her about the benefits that she thought came from believing in God, I introduced the Litany of Tarski—which is actually an infinite family of litanies, a specific example being:

  _If the sky is blue_
      _I desire to believe "the sky is blue"_
  _If the sky is not blue_
      _I desire to believe "the sky is not blue"._

"This is not my philosophy," she said to me.

"I didn't think it was," I replied to her.  "I'm just asking—assuming that God does not exist, and this is known, then should you still believe in God?"

She hesitated.  She seemed to really be trying to think about it, which surprised me.

"So it's a counterfactual question..." she said slowly.

I thought at the time that she was having difficulty allowing herself to visualize the world where God does not exist, because of her attachment to a God-containing world.

Now, however, I suspect she was having difficulty visualizing a contrast between the way the world would look if God existed or did not exist, because all her thoughts were about her belief in God, but her causal network modelling the world did not contain God as a node.  So she could easily answer "How would the world look different if I didn't believe in God?", but not "How would the world look different if there was no God?"

She didn't answer that question, at the time.  But she did produce a counterexample to the Litany of Tarski:

She said, "I believe that people are nicer than they really are."


I tried to explain that if you say, "People are bad," that means you believe people are bad, and if you say, "I believe people are nice", that means you believe you believe people are nice.  So saying "People are bad and I believe people are nice" means you believe people are bad but you believe you believe people are nice.

I quoted to her:

  "If there were a verb meaning 'to believe falsely', it would not have any significant first person, present indicative."
          —Ludwig Wittgenstein

She said, smiling, "Yes, I believe people are nicer than, in fact, they are.  I just thought I should put it that way for you."

  "I reckon Granny ought to have a good look at you, Walter," said Nanny.  "I reckon your mind's all tangled up like a ball of string what's been dropped."
          —Terry Pratchett, Maskerade

And I can type out the words, "Well, I guess she didn't believe that her reasoning ought to be consistent under reflection," but I'm still having trouble coming to grips with it.

I can see the pattern in the words coming out of her lips, but I can't understand the mind behind on an empathic level.  I can imagine myself into the shoes of baby-eating aliens and the Lady 3rd Kiritsugu, but I cannot imagine what it is like to be her.  Or maybe I just don't want to?

This is why intelligent people only have a certain amount of time (measured in subjective time spent thinking about religion) to become atheists.  After a certain point, if you're smart, have spent time thinking about and defending your religion, and still haven't escaped the grip of Dark Side Epistemology, the inside of your mind ends up as an Escher painting.

(One of the other few moments that gave her pause—I mention this, in case you have occasion to use it—is when she was talking about how it's good to believe that someone cares whether you do right or wrong—not, of course, talking about how there actually is a God who cares whether you do right or wrong, this proposition is not part of her religion—

And I said, "But I care whether you do right or wrong.  So what you're saying is that this isn't enough, and you also need to believe in something above humanity that cares whether you do right or wrong."  So that stopped her, for a bit, because of course she'd never thought of it in those terms before.  Just a standard application of the nonstandard toolbox.)

Later on, at one point, I was asking her if it would be good to do anything differently if there definitely was no God, and this time, she answered, "No."

"So," I said incredulously, "if God exists or doesn't exist, that has absolutely no effect on how it would be good for people to think or act?  I think even a rabbi would look a little askance at that."

Her religion seems to now consist entirely of the worship of worship.  As the true believers of older times might have believed that an all-seeing father would save them, she now believes that belief in God will save her.

After she said "I believe people are nicer than they are," I asked, "So, are you consistently surprised when people undershoot your expectations?"  There was a long silence, and then, slowly:  "Well... am I surprised when people... undershoot my expectations?"

I didn't understand this pause at the time.  I'd intended it to suggest that if she was constantly disappointed by reality, then this was a downside of believing falsely.   But she seemed, instead, to be taken aback at the implications of not being surprised.

I now realize that the whole essence of her philosophy was her belief that she had deceived herself, and the possibility that her estimates of other people were actually accurate, threatened the Dark Side Epistemology that she had built around beliefs such as "I benefit from believing people are nicer than they actually are."

She has taken the old idol off its throne, and replaced it with an explicit worship of the Dark Side Epistemology that was once invented to defend the idol; she worships her own attempt at self-deception.  The attempt failed, but she is honestly unaware of this.

And so humanity's token guardians of sanity (motto: "pooping your deranged little party since Epicurus") must now fight the active worship of self-deception—the worship of the supposed benefits of faith, in place of God.

This actually explains a fact about myself that I didn't really understand earlier—the reason why I'm annoyed when people talk as if self-deception is easy, and why I write entire blog posts arguing that making a deliberate choice to believe the sky is green, is harder to get away with than people seem to think.

It's because—while you can't just choose to believe the sky is green—if you don't realize this fact, then you actually can fool yourself into believing that you've successfully deceived yourself.

And since you then sincerely expect to receive the benefits that you think come from self-deception, you get the same sort of placebo benefit that would actually come from a successful self-deception.

So by going around explaining how hard self-deception is, I'm actually taking direct aim at the placebo benefits that people get from believing that they've deceived themselves, and targeting the new sort of religion that worships only the worship of God.

Will this battle, I wonder, generate a new list of reasons why, not belief, but belief in belief, is itself a good thing?  Why people derive great benefits from worshipping their worship?  Will we have to do this over again with belief in belief in belief and worship of worship of worship?  Or will intelligent theists finally just give up on that line of argument?

I wish I could believe that no one could possibly believe in belief in belief in belief, but the Zombie World argument in philosophy has gotten even more tangled than this and its proponents still haven't abandoned it.

I await the eager defenses of belief in belief in the comments, but I wonder if anyone would care to jump ahead of the game and defend belief in belief in belief?  Might as well go ahead and get it over with.
