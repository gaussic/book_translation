## 双重思想（选择偏见）

> 一张长方形的报纸碎片出现在奥布莱恩的手指间。大约五秒钟，它处在温斯顿的视线范围内。那是一张照片，毫无疑问，就是那张照片。那是琼斯、阿伦森和卢瑟福在纽约某次聚会上拍的照片的另一份拷贝，十一年前他偶然发现并立刻销毁过。照片只在他眼前一瞬间，随即又消失了。但他确实看见了，毫无疑问他看见了！他拼命挣扎，想让上半身脱离束缚，但哪怕一厘米都动不了。此刻他甚至忘记了仪表盘。他只想再一次把那张照片握在手里，哪怕只是再看一眼也好。

> “它存在！”他喊道。
>
> “不，”奥布莱恩说。
>
> 他走到房间另一边。
>
> 对面墙上有个记忆孔。奥布莱恩掀开格栅。那张脆弱的纸片在温暖气流中旋转着消失了，一瞬间就化为火焰。奥布莱恩转身离开墙壁。
>
> “灰烬，”他说，“连能辨认的灰烬都没有。尘埃。它不存在。它从未存在过。”
>
> “可它确实存在过！它现在也存在！它存在于记忆中。我记得，你也记得。”
>
> “我不记得了。”奥布莱恩说。
>
> 温斯顿心如死灰。这就是双重思想。他感到一种致命的无力。如果他能确定奥布莱恩是在撒谎，倒也无所谓。但完全有可能奥布莱恩真的忘了那张照片。如果是这样，他早就忘了自己否认记得这件事，也忘了自己曾经忘记过。你怎么能确定这只是诡计？也许那种疯狂的心智错乱真的会发生：正是这个念头击垮了他。

如果自欺能让我们更快乐怎么办？如果直接去克服偏见反而会让我们——天哪！——变得不快乐呢？真正的智慧难道不是“二阶理性”，选择什么时候理性？这样你就可以决定让哪些认知偏差支配你，以最大化你的幸福。

抛开道德不谈，我怀疑这种疯狂的心智错乱真的可能发生。

二阶理性意味着你会在某个时刻对自己说：“现在，我要非理性地相信自己会中彩票，以让自己开心。”但我们并不能直接控制自己的信念。你无法靠意志让自己相信天空是绿色的。你或许能让自己相信“自己相信了”——不过我刚刚指出了两者的区别，这会让你更难做到（不客气！）。你甚至可能相信自己很快乐且自欺了；但你实际上并不会真的快乐且自欺。

要让二阶理性真正理性，你首先需要一个对现实的良好模型，来推演理性和非理性的后果。如果你随后选择一阶非理性，你还得忘掉这个准确的认知，然后再忘记自己忘记过。我并不是想犯“用虚构证据泛化”的逻辑谬误，但我觉得奥威尔很好地推演了这条路的尽头。

在你已经去偏见之前，你无法知道偏见的后果。而那时，想自欺已经太晚了。

另一种选择是盲目地选择继续偏见，根本不清楚后果。这不是二阶理性，而是有意的愚蠢。

对自己的驾驶技术盲目乐观，你会在别人紧张害怕时无忧无虑。你不用忍受安全带的麻烦。你会无忧无虑一天、一周、一年。然后——砰！——你余生都在希望能挠到幻肢的瘙痒，或者脖子以下瘫痪，或者直接丧命。这不是必然，但有可能；概率有多大？除非你知道自己真实的驾驶水平，才能理性权衡自己置身的危险有多大。除非你了解“忽视概率”等偏见，否则你无法理性权衡。

无论你在幸福的无知中度过多少天，只要一次错误就足以毁掉一生，抵消你在愚蠢铁轨上捡到的所有零钱。

我给理性主义新手的主要建议之一就是“别试图耍聪明”。还有，“倾听那些安静、挥之不去的疑虑”。如果你不知道，你就不知道自己不知道什么，不知道自己有多无知，也不知道自己本该知道多少。

没有什么二阶理性。只有盲目一跃，跳进可能是火山岩浆坑的地方。一旦你知道了，就再也无法盲目。

但人们总是忽略这一点，因为他们不知道自己不知道什么。未知的未知是不可得的。他们不会关注地图上的空白区域，而是把它当作现实中的空白地带。当他们考虑盲目一跃时，会在记忆中查找危险，却在空白地图上找不到火山岩浆坑。那为什么不跳呢？

我试过。我跳过。我被烧伤过。别试图耍聪明。

我曾对朋友说，我怀疑“愚蠢的幸福”被严重高估了。她却很认真地摇头说：“不，不是的，真的不是。”

也许确实有愚蠢而幸福的人。也许他们比你更快乐。人生本就不公平，你也不会因为嫉妒得不到的东西而更快乐。我怀疑绝大多数 Overcoming Bias 的读者即使努力也无法获得“愚蠢的幸福”。那条路对你已经关闭。你永远无法达到那种无知，你无法忘记你所知道的，无法对你所见之事视而不见。

“愚蠢的幸福”对你来说已经关闭。除非真的脑损伤，否则你永远不会拥有它，甚至那时也未必能有。我觉得你应该思考一下，“愚蠢的幸福”是否最优——是否是人类能追求的最大幸福——但这其实无关紧要。那条路对你来说已经关闭，如果它曾经开放过的话。

现在你唯一能做的，就是追求理性主义者能获得的那种幸福。我认为最终它可能更伟大。人生有平坦的高原，也有需要攀登的高山；即使攀登更费力，山顶终究更高。

而且，人生不止有幸福；你的决定还可能影响他人的幸福。

但这都无关紧要。当你意识到自己有选择时，其实已经没有选择。你无法对你所见之事视而不见。那条路已经关闭。

## Doublethink (Choosing to be Biased)

> An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between O'Brien's fingers. For perhaps five seconds it was within the angle of Winston's vision. It was a photograph, and there was no question of its > identity. It was the photograph. It was another copy of the photograph of Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford at the party function in New York, which he had chanced upon eleven years ago and promptly destroyed. For only an instant it was before his eyes, then it was out of sight again. But he had seen it, unquestionably he had seen it! He made a desperate, agonizing effort to wrench the top half of his body free. It was impossible to move so much as a centimetre in any direction. For the moment he had even forgotten the dial. All he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again, or at least to see it.
>
> 'It exists!' he cried.
> 
> 'No,' said O'Brien.
> 
> He stepped across the room.
> 
> There was a memory hole in the opposite wall. O'Brien lifted the grating. Unseen, the frail slip of paper was whirling away on the current of warm air; it was vanishing in a flash of flame. O'Brien turned away from the wall.
> 
> 'Ashes,' he said. 'Not even identifiable ashes. Dust. It does not exist. It never existed.'
> 
> 'But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in memory. I remember it. You remember it.'
> 
> 'I do not remember it,' said O'Brien.
> 
> Winston's heart sank. That was doublethink. He had a feeling of deadly helplessness. If he could have been certain that O'Brien was lying, it would not have seemed to matter. But it was perfectly possible that O'Brien had really forgotten the photograph. And if so, then already he would have forgotten his denial of remembering it, and forgotten the act of forgetting. How could one be sure that it was simple trickery? Perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen: that was the thought that defeated him.

>    —George Orwell, 1984

What if self-deception helps us be happy?  What if just running out and overcoming bias will make us—gasp!—unhappy?  Surely, true wisdom would be second-order rationality, choosing when to be rational.  That way you can decide which cognitive biases should govern you, to maximize your happiness.

Leaving the morality aside, I doubt such a lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen.


Second-order rationality implies that at some point, you will think to yourself, "And now, I will irrationally believe that I will win the lottery, in order to make myself happy."  But we do not have such direct control over our beliefs.  You cannot make yourself believe the sky is green by an act of will.  You might be able to believe you believed it—though I have just made that more difficult for you by pointing out the difference.  (You're welcome!)  You might even believe you were happy and self-deceived; but you would not in fact be happy and self-deceived.

For second-order rationality to be genuinely rational, you would first need a good model of reality, to extrapolate the consequences of rationality and irrationality.  If you then chose to be first-order irrational, you would need to forget this accurate view. And then forget the act of forgetting.  I don't mean to commit the logical fallacy of generalizing from fictional evidence, but I think Orwell did a good job of extrapolating where this path leads.

You can't know the consequences of being biased, until you have already debiased yourself.  And then it is too late for self-deception.

The other alternative is to choose blindly to remain biased, without any clear idea of the consequences.  This is not second-order rationality.  It is willful stupidity.

Be irrationally optimistic about your driving skills, and you will be happily unconcerned where others sweat and fear.  You won't have to put up with the inconvenience of a seatbelt.  You will be happily unconcerned for a day, a week, a year.  Then CRASH, and spend the rest of your life wishing you could scratch the itch in your phantom limb.  Or paralyzed from the neck down.  Or dead.  It's not inevitable, but it's possible; how probable is it?  You can't make that tradeoff rationally unless you know your real driving skills, so you can figure out how much danger you're placing yourself in.  You can't make that tradeoff rationally unless you know about biases like neglect of probability.

No matter how many days go by in blissful ignorance, it only takes a single mistake to undo a human life, to outweigh every penny you picked up from the railroad tracks of stupidity.

One of chief pieces of advice I give to aspiring rationalists is "Don't try to be clever." And, "Listen to those quiet, nagging doubts."  If you don't know, you don't know what you don't know, you don't know how much you don't know, and you don't know how much you needed to know.

There is no second-order rationality.  There is only a blind leap into what may or may not be a flaming lava pit.  Once you know, it will be too late for blindness.

But people neglect this, because they do not know what they do not know.  Unknown unknowns are not available. They do not focus on the blank area on the map, but treat it as if it corresponded to a blank territory.  When they consider leaping blindly, they check their memory for dangers, and find no flaming lava pits in the blank map.  Why not leap?

Been there.  Tried that.  Got burned.  Don't try to be clever.

I once said to a friend that I suspected the happiness of stupidity was greatly overrated.  And she shook her head seriously, and said, "No, it's not; it's really not."

Maybe there are stupid happy people out there.  Maybe they are happier than you are.  And life isn't fair, and you won't become happier by being jealous of what you can't have.  I suspect the vast majority of Overcoming Bias readers could not achieve the "happiness of stupidity" if they tried.  That way is closed to you. You can never achieve that degree of ignorance, you cannot forget what you know, you cannot unsee what you see. 

The happiness of stupidity is closed to you.  You will never have it short of actual brain damage, and maybe not even then.  You should wonder, I think, whether the happiness of stupidity is optimal—if it is the most happiness that a human can aspire to—but it matters not.  That way is closed to you, if it was ever open.

All that is left to you now, is to aspire to such happiness as a rationalist can achieve.  I think it may prove greater, in the end. There are bounded paths and open-ended paths; plateaus on which to laze, and mountains to climb; and if climbing takes more effort, still the mountain rises higher in the end.

Also there is more to life than happiness; and other happinesses than your own may be at stake in your decisions.

But that is moot.  By the time you realize you have a choice, there is no choice.  You cannot unsee what you see.  The other way is closed.
