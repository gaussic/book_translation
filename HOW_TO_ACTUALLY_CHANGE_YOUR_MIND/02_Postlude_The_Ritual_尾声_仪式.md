## 尾声：仪式

Jeffreyssai 用来接待非 beisutsukai 访客的房间安静而正式，布置得一丝不苟，完全符合最保守的审美。阳光和外面的空气透过一层抛光银制的格栅洒入，几处锋利的边缘清楚地表明这堵墙是不能打开的。地板和墙壁都是玻璃，厚度足以让其产生些许扭曲，也足够深厚，以至于下面藏着什么都无关紧要。玻璃表面上刻着一些没有特定含义的细微图案，仿佛出自一个有艺术天赋的孩子之手（事实上确实如此）。

Jeffreyssai 家中还有风格各异的房间；但他发现，外人对贝叶斯大师的期待就是如此，于是他也乐得不去点破。毕竟，这种静静的自得，是生活中的小小乐趣之一。

客人跪坐在他对面，膝盖落在垫子上，脚跟收于身后。她此行完全是为了她的“阴谋”事务，穿着也体现了这一点：一身贴身的粉色皮革连体衣，连手都戴着手套——一直包到头部的兜帽，虽然脸部坦然无遮。

因此，Jeffreyssai 选择在这个房间接待她。

Jeffreyssai 长长地呼出一口气。“你确定吗？”

“哦，”她说，“难道我非得绝对确定，才能让我的建议影响你的看法吗？难道我作为领域专家，而你不是，这还不够吗？”

Jeffreyssai 嘴角微微上扬，露出半个微笑。“你怎么会这么懂规则？你可连普朗克长度的正规训练都没受过。”

“你还用问吗？”她淡淡地说，“你们 beisutsukai 最喜欢做的事情之一，就是不停地讲自己为什么要这么做。”

Jeffreyssai 一想到靠看别人讨论理性来学理性，心里就忍不住一阵抽搐——

“别在心里对我皱眉头，”她说，“我可没打算自己成为理性主义者，只是想赢一场和理性主义者的辩论。这是两回事，你肯定也会这么教你的学生。”

她真的能看穿我吗？Jeffreyssai 望向银色格栅外，山坡上反射着阳光。在这片高于云层的地方，金色的阳光每天都如约而至，永恒不变。那光代表的遥远太阳，五十亿年后会燃尽；但此刻，太阳依然照耀着。而这永远不会改变。既然这个愿望已经被绝对地实现了，又何必再奢望一切永远不变？永恒与无常的悖论：只有在后者的视角下，才有进步或失去的意义。

“你一直都给了我很好的建议，”Jeffreyssai 说，“这一点从未改变。自我们相识以来一直如此。”

她微微点头，表示认可。这是事实，无需多言。

“所以，”Jeffreyssai 说，“不是为了争论，只是因为我想知道答案。你确定吗？”他甚至想不出她是怎么猜到的。

“挺确定的，”她说，“我们收集了很久的数据，在一千个类似你的案例里，有九百八十五个——”

看到他脸上的表情，她笑了。“不，我开玩笑的。当然我不确定。这件事只有你自己能决定。但我可以肯定，你应该去做你们那一套——我敢肯定你们有某种仪式，哪怕你们不会跟外人谈——当你们认真考虑要放弃自己长期坚持的某个前提时。”

对此很难反驳，Jeffreyssai 想，尤其是当领域专家告诉你，你其实很可能错了的时候。

“我认输。”Jeffreyssai 说。从他嘴里说出这句话，带着一种不容置疑的终结意味。无需再和我争论：你赢了。

“别这样。”她说。她一气呵成地从垫子上起身，动作流畅，没有丝毫多余。她既不炫耀自己的年纪，也不刻意掩饰。她握住他伸出的手，郑重地吻了一下。“告别了，老师。”

“告别？”Jeffreyssai 反问。这比“再见”更高一级的离别。“我还打算再去拜访你，夫人；你在这里永远受欢迎。”

她没有回答，径直走向门口。在门口她停下脚步，没有回头。“一切都不会再一样了。”她说。然后，她的动作毫不慌乱，却快得几乎像消失了一样，离开了。

Jeffreyssai 叹了口气。但至少，从现在到正式挑战开始，他的每一步都已被规定好，都是已知的量。

离开那个正式的会客厅，他走向自己的演武场，让人给学生们送信，通知他们第二天的课程要临时安排，因为他要缺席，之后还会有一次测试。

然后他什么特别的事也没做。他又读了借来的教科书一百页；这本书其实不怎么样，不过他借出去的那本也好不到哪去。他在家里各个房间闲逛，顺便检查有没有什么东西被偷（只少了一副扑克牌，仅此而已）。偶尔他会想到明天的挑战，但只是任由思绪飘荡。完全不去主动思考，只是屏蔽掉所有以前想过的念头，也不允许自己得出任何结论，甚至不去想自己的思路会往哪里发展。

太阳落山了，他看了一会儿，心神刻意保持在“空档”状态。让大脑处于空档而不去执着、也不费力维持，这是一种极妙的平衡。多年前他还会为此苦恼，但现在早已驾轻就熟。

第二天早晨，他醒来时，夜里梦境的混乱还很鲜明。他尽力保留那份混沌的感觉和记忆，下楼梯，又下一层楼梯，再下一层楼梯，最终来到全屋最不起眼的房间。

房间是白色的。基本上，色彩就只有这个。

一整面墙上挂着铭牌，按照经典和推荐的方法，是年轻时的 Jeffreyssai 一笔一划亲手刻下的，每一笔都把理念深深烙进脑海。能被真相摧毁的东西就该被摧毁。人们能够承受真实，因为他们早已在承受它。好奇心渴望自我消灭。还有一块小铭牌，上面只画着一道红色的横杠。符号可以代表任何事物；这种视觉象征的灵活性，连吟游诗人阴谋团都不敢明说。

铭牌下方，墙上刻着两组记号。加号那栏有两道，减号那栏有五道。他七次走进这个房间；五次决定不改变想法；两次离开时已是不同的人。没有规定比例或范围——那样反倒成了笑话。但如果加号那栏很久都没有新记号，你也该承认这个房间毫无意义，因为你根本没有它所代表的能力。要么如此，要么你生来就知道一切真理和正义。

Jeffreyssai 坐下，背对铭牌，面朝一面空白的白墙。这样视觉上不会被干扰。

他在脑海中先默念总口诀，然后回忆与之相关的各个分口诀，涵盖了“改变想法仪式”中最可能用到的七大原则和六十二项具体技巧。除此之外，Jeffreyssai 又加了一条口诀，提醒自己曾经最尴尬的十四个疏漏。

他没有深呼吸。正常呼吸最好。

然后，他向自己提出了那个问题。

## Postlude: The_Ritual

The room in which Jeffreyssai received his non-beisutsukai visitors was quietly formal, impeccably appointed in only the most conservative tastes. Sunlight and outside air streamed through a grillwork of polished silver, a few sharp edges making it clear that this wall was not to be opened. The floor and walls were glass, thick enough to distort, to a depth sufficient that it didn’t matter what might be underneath. Upon the surfaces of the glass were subtly scratched patterns of no particular meaning, scribed as if by the hand of an artistically inclined child (and this was in fact the case).

Elsewhere in Jeffreyssai’s home there were rooms of other style; but this, he had found, was what most outsiders expected of a Bayesian Master, and he chose not to enlighten them otherwise. That quiet amusement was one of life’s little joys, after all.

The guest sat across from him, knees on the pillow and heels behind. She was here solely upon the business of her Conspiracy, and her attire showed it: a form-fitting jumpsuit of pink leather with even her hands gloved—all the way to the hood covering her head and hair, though her face lay plain and unconcealed beneath.

And so Jeffreyssai had chosen to receive her in this room.

Jeffreyssai let out a long breath, exhaling. “Are you sure?”

“Oh,” she said, “and do I have to be absolutely certain before my advice can shift your opinions? Does it not suffice that I am a domain expert, and you are not?”

Jeffreyssai’s mouth twisted up at the corner in a half-smile. “How do you know so much about the rules, anyway? You’ve never had so much as a Planck length of formal training.”

“Do you even need to ask?” she said dryly. “If there’s one thing that you beisutsukai do love to go on about, it’s the reasons why you do things.”

Jeffreyssai inwardly winced at the thought of trying to pick up rationality by watching other people talk about it—

“And don’t inwardly wince at me like that,” she said. “I’m not trying to be a rationalist myself, just trying to win an argument with a rationalist. There’s a difference, as I’m sure you tell your students.”

Can she really read me that well? Jeffreyssai looked out through the silver grillwork, at the sunlight reflected from the faceted mountainside. Always, always the golden sunlight fell each day, in this place far above the clouds. An unchanging thing, that light. The distant Sun, which that light represented, was in five billion years burned out; but now, in this moment, the Sun still shone. And that could never alter. Why wish for things to stay the same way forever, when that wish was already granted as absolutely as any wish could be? The paradox of permanence and impermanence: only in the latter perspective was there any such thing as progress, or loss.

“You have always given me good counsel,” Jeffreyssai said. “Unchanging, that has been. Through all the time we’ve known each other.”

She inclined her head, acknowledging. This was true, and there was no need to spell out the implications.

“So,” Jeffreyssai said. “Not for the sake of arguing. Only because I want to know the answer. Are you sure?” He didn’t even see how she could guess.

“Pretty sure,” she said, “we’ve been collecting statistics for a long time, and in nine hundred and eighty-five out of a thousand cases like yours—”

Then she laughed at the look on his face. “No, I’m joking. Of course I’m not sure. This thing only you can decide. But I am sure that you should go off and do whatever it is you people do—I’m quite sure you have a ritual for it, even if you won’t discuss it with outsiders—when you very seriously consider abandoning a long-held premise of your existence.”

It was hard to argue with that, Jeffreyssai reflected, the more so when a domain expert had told you that you were, in fact, probably wrong.

“I concede,” Jeffreyssai said. Coming from his lips, the phrase was spoken with a commanding finality. There is no need to argue with me any further: you have won.

“Oh, stop it,” she said. She rose from her pillow in a single fluid shift without the slightest wasted motion. She didn’t flaunt her age, but she didn’t conceal it either. She took his outstretched hand, and raised it to her lips for a formal kiss. “Farewell, sensei.”

“Farewell?” repeated Jeffreyssai. That signified a higher order of departure than goodbye. “I do intend to visit you again, milady; and you are always welcome here.”

She walked toward the door without answering. At the doorway she paused, without turning around. “It won’t be the same,” she said. And then, without the movements seeming the least rushed, she walked away so swiftly it was almost like vanishing.

Jeffreyssai sighed. But at least, from here until the challenge proper, all his actions were prescribed, known quantities.

Leaving that formal reception area, he passed to his arena, and caused to be sent out messengers to his students, telling them that the next day’s classes must be improvised in his absence, and that there would be a test later.

And then he did nothing in particular. He read another hundred pages of the textbook he had borrowed; it wasn’t very good, but then the book he had loaned out in exchange wasn’t very good either. He wandered from room to room of his house, idly checking various storages to see if anything had been stolen (a deck of cards was missing, but that was all). From time to time his thoughts turned to tomorrow’s challenge, and he let them drift. Not directing his thoughts at all, only blocking out every thought that had ever previously occurred to him; and disallowing any kind of conclusion, or even any thought as to where his thoughts might be trending.

The sun set, and he watched it for a while, mind carefully put in idle. It was a fantastic balancing act to set your mind in idle without having to obsess about it, or exert energy to keep it that way; and years ago he would have sweated over it, but practice had long since made perfect.

The next morning he awoke with the chaos of the night’s dreaming fresh in his mind, and, doing his best to preserve the feeling of the chaos as well as its memory, he descended a flight of stairs, then another flight of stairs, then a flight of stairs after that, and finally came to the least fashionable room in his whole house.

It was white. That was pretty much it as far as the color scheme went.

All along a single wall were plaques, which, following the classic and suggested method, a younger Jeffreyssai had very carefully scribed himself, burning the concepts into his mind with each touch of the brush that wrote the words. That which can be destroyed by the truth should be. People can stand what is true, for they are already enduring it. Curiosity seeks to annihilate itself. Even one small plaque that showed nothing except a red horizontal slash. Symbols could be made to stand for anything; a flexibility of visual power that even the Bardic Conspiracy would balk at admitting outright.

Beneath the plaques, two sets of tally marks scratched into the wall. Under the plus column, two marks. Under the minus column, five marks. Seven times he had entered this room; five times he had decided not to change his mind; twice he had exited something of a different person. There was no set ratio prescribed, or set range—that would have been a mockery indeed. But if there were no marks in the plus column after a while, you might as well admit that there was no point in having the room, since you didn’t have the ability it stood for. Either that, or you’d been born knowing the truth and right of everything.

Jeffreyssai seated himself, not facing the plaques, but facing away from them, at the featureless white wall. It was better to have no visual distractions.

In his mind, he rehearsed first the meta-mnemonic, and then the various sub-mnemonics referenced, for the seven major principles and sixty-two specific techniques that were most likely to prove needful in the Ritual Of Changing One’s Mind. To this, Jeffreyssai added another mnemonic, reminding himself of his own fourteen most embarrassing oversights.

He did not take a deep breath. Regular breathing was best.

And then he asked himself the question.
