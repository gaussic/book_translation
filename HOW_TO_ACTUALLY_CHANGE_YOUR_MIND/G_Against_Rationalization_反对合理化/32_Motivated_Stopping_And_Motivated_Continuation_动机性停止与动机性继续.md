## 动机性停止与动机性继续

虽然我不同意“快速与节俭”学派的一些观点——在我看来，他们有点过于把柠檬变成柠檬水了——但我也认为，他们往往发展出了所有决策理论流派中最贴近心理现实的模型。大多数实验会直接给受试者提供选项，然后让受试者做出选择，这就是实验结果。而“节俭派”意识到，在现实生活中，你必须自己生成选项，并研究人们是如何做到这一点的。

同样，虽然许多实验会把证据“端到你面前”，但在现实生活中，你必须自己去收集证据，这往往是有代价的，并且你必须在某个时刻决定证据已经足够，可以停止收集并做出选择。比如买房时，你不会正好有十套房子可选，也不会在做决定前被带着参观所有房子。你会看一套，再看一套，相互比较；你会调整自己的期望——重新考虑到底有多需要离工作地点近、到底愿意付多少钱；你会决定下一步看哪套房；最终你会觉得看得差不多了，然后做出选择。

吉洛维奇区分了“动机性怀疑”和“动机性轻信”，指出人们对不愿相信的结论要求更高的标准，而对愿意相信的结论则标准更低。动机性怀疑者会问证据是否“迫使”自己接受结论；动机性轻信者则只问证据是否“允许”自己接受结论。

我认为，在心理现实的搜索过程中，也有类似的偏见：动机性停止和动机性继续。当我们内心有动机选择当前“最优”选项时，我们就有动机停止搜索、做出选择，并拒绝继续考虑更多选项。当我们内心有动机拒绝当前最优选项时，我们就有动机暂停判断，继续收集更多证据，生成更多选项——总之，找点别的事做，拖延下结论。

统计学史上有个著名丑闻：该领域奠基人之一 R.A. Fisher 坚持认为吸烟和肺癌之间没有因果关系。他在国会作证时说：“相关不等于因果。”也许吸烟者有某种基因，既让他们更容易吸烟，也更容易得肺癌。

或者，也许 Fisher 受雇于烟草公司，内心有动机认为现有证据还不足以下结论，最好继续寻找更多证据。Fisher 本人也是烟民，1962 年死于结肠癌。<sup>1</sup>

和许多其他动机性怀疑一样，动机性继续也常常伪装成美德理性。谁能反对多收集点证据呢？<sup>2</sup>

我可以。证据往往代价高昂，更糟的是很慢，而且拒绝整合已有证据绝不是美德。你随时都可以改变主意。<sup>3</sup>

至于动机性停止，它出现在你害怕第三种选择的每个场合，也出现在你有一个论点但不愿面对明显反驳时，还会出现在其他地方。当你采取某种行动，仅仅因为行动本身让你感觉良好，所以你不愿调查计划实际效果如何，害怕破坏自己花钱买来的道德满足感时，这种现象就会出现。<sup>4</sup> 只要你的信念和预期不一致，你就有理由害怕任何新证据。<sup>5</sup>

结论是，决定何时终止（暂时或永久）搜索过程，本身也会受到偏见和隐藏动机的影响。你应该怀疑自己动机性停止：当你在得出一个让自己舒服的结论后就停止搜索，而其实还有很多快速、廉价的证据没收集——比如还有网站可以查，还有反反驳可以思考，或者你还没闭上眼睛按表静想五分钟有没有更好的选项。当你发现有些证据朝着你不喜欢的方向倾斜，但你决定还需要更多证据——而这些证据又很昂贵、短期内无法获得，而不是你能在30分钟内用谷歌查到的——你就该怀疑自己动机性继续，因为你只是在拖延面对不舒服的行动。

## Motivated Stopping and Motivated Continuation

While I disagree with some views of the Fast and Frugal crowd—in my opinion they make a few too many lemons into lemonade—it also seems to me that they tend to develop the most psychologically realistic models of any school of decision theory. Most experiments present the subjects with options, and the subject chooses an option, and that’s the experimental result. The frugalists realized that in real life, you have to generate your options, and they studied how subjects did that.

Likewise, although many experiments present evidence on a silver platter, in real life you have to gather evidence, which may be costly, and at some point decide that you have enough evidence to stop and choose. When you’re buying a house, you don’t get exactly ten houses to choose from, and you aren’t led on a guided tour of all of them before you’re allowed to decide anything. You look at one house, and another, and compare them to each other; you adjust your aspirations—reconsider how much you really need to be close to your workplace and how much you’re really willing to pay; you decide which house to look at next; and at some point you decide that you’ve seen enough houses, and choose.

Gilovich’s distinction between motivated skepticism and motivated credulity highlights how conclusions a person does not want to believe are held to a higher standard than conclusions a person wants to believe. A motivated skeptic asks if the evidence compels them to accept the conclusion; a motivated credulist asks if the evidence allows them to accept the conclusion.

I suggest that an analogous bias in psychologically realistic search is motivated stopping and motivated continuation: when we have a hidden motive for choosing the “best” current option, we have a hidden motive to stop, and choose, and reject consideration of any more options. When we have a hidden motive to reject the current best option, we have a hidden motive to suspend judgment pending additional evidence, to generate more options— to find something, anything, to do instead of coming to a conclusion.

A major historical scandal in statistics was R. A. Fisher, an eminent founder of the field, insisting that no causal link had been established between smoking and lung cancer. “Correlation is not causation,” he testified to Congress. Perhaps smokers had a gene which both predisposed them to smoke and predisposed them to lung cancer.

Or maybe Fisher’s being employed as a consultant for tobacco firms gave him a hidden motive to decide that the evidence already gathered was insufficient to come to a conclusion, and it was better to keep looking. Fisher was also a smoker himself, and died of colon cancer in 1962.<sup>1</sup>

Like many other forms of motivated skepticism, motivated continuation can try to disguise itself as virtuous rationality. Who can argue against gathering more evidence?<sup>2</sup>

I can. Evidence is often costly, and worse, slow, and there is certainly nothing virtuous about refusing to integrate the evidence you already have. You can always change your mind later.<sup>3</sup>

As for motivated stopping, it appears in every place a third alternative is feared, and wherever you have an argument whose obvious counterargument you would rather not see, and in other places as well. It appears when you pursue a course of action that makes you feel good just for acting, and so you’d rather not investigate how well your plan really worked, for fear of destroying the warm glow of moral satisfaction you paid good money to purchase.<sup>4</sup> It appears wherever your beliefs and anticipations get out of sync, so you have a reason to fear any new evidence gathered.<sup>5</sup>

The moral is that the decision to terminate a search procedure (temporarily or permanently) is, like the search procedure itself, subject to bias and hidden motives. You should suspect motivated stopping when you close off search, after coming to a comfortable conclusion, and yet there’s a lot of fast cheap evidence you haven’t gathered yet—there are websites you could visit, there are counter-counter arguments you could consider, or you haven’t closed your eyes for five minutes by the clock trying to think of a better option. You should suspect motivated continuation when some evidence is leaning in a way you don’t like, but you decide that more evidence is needed—expensive evidence that you know you can’t gather anytime soon, as opposed to something you’re going to look up on Google in thirty minutes—before you’ll have to do anything uncomfortable.
