## 谎言与黑天鹅式的崩盘

马库斯·艾因菲尔德法官，70岁，自1977年起为御用大律师，1997年被评为澳大利亚“国宝”，2002年获联合国和平奖，澳大利亚人权与机会平等委员会创始主席，几年前退休，但经常被召回审理重要案件……

……却因为一连串的伪证和谎言而入狱两年，而这一切的起因只是一起77澳元、超速6英里的罚单。

关于诚实的人不擅长撒谎、总会留下某种纠缠的痕迹、最终一切会以黑天鹅式的灾难性崩盘收场，这种听起来有点道德说教意味的理论，现实中其实确实有不少例证，尽管我们听到的这些故事显然有选择性报道的成分

## Of Lies and Black Swan Blowups

Judge Marcus Einfeld, age 70, Queen’s Counsel since 1977, Australian Living Treasure 1997, United Nations Peace Award 2002, founding president of Australia’s Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission, retired a few years back but routinely brought back to judge important cases . . .

. . . went to jail for two years over a series of perjuries and lies that started with a $77, 6-mph-over speeding ticket.

That whole suspiciously virtuous-sounding theory about honest people not being good at lying, and entangled traces being left somewhere, and the entire thing blowing up in a Black Swan epic fail, actually does have a certain number of exemplars in real life, though obvious selective reporting is at work in our hearing about this one.
