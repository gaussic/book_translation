## 结论先行

有两个密封的箱子正在拍卖，A箱和B箱。只有其中一个箱子里有一颗珍贵的钻石。各种迹象和征兆都可能暗示哪个箱子里有钻石，但我没有任何一个迹象是绝对可靠的。比如，有一个箱子上有蓝色印章，我知道有钻石的箱子比空箱子更可能有蓝色印章。或者有一个箱子表面很光亮，我怀疑——但不确定——有钻石的箱子从来不会是光亮的。

现在，假设有个聪明的辩手，手里拿着一张纸，对A箱和B箱的主人说：“来竞标我的服务，谁出价高，我就为谁辩护，说他们的箱子里有钻石，这样他们的箱子就能卖出更高的价格。”于是箱主们开始竞标，B箱的主人出价更高，赢得了这位聪明辩手的服务。

聪明的辩手开始组织思路。首先，他在纸的最下方写下：“所以，B箱里有钻石！”然后，在纸的最上方写下：“B箱有蓝色印章”，下面写上“A箱很光亮”，再写上“B箱比A箱更轻”，如此罗列了许多迹象和征兆；但他忽略了所有可能支持A箱的迹象。接着，这位聪明的辩手拿着纸来找我，照本宣科：“B箱有蓝色印章，A箱很光亮……”最后总结：“所以，B箱里有钻石。”

但请思考：就在聪明辩手写下结论的那一刻，他把墨水写在纸上的那一刻，这些物理墨迹与物理箱子的证据纠缠关系就已经固定了。

你可以想象有许多世界——比如埃弗雷特分支或泰格马克多重宇宙——在这些世界中，A箱或B箱含有钻石的客观频率是确定的。<sup>1</sup>

纸上的墨水形成了奇特的形状和曲线，组成了这句话：“所以，B箱里有钻石。”如果你碰巧是个识字的英语读者，你可能会被迷惑，以为这些墨迹的形状真的意味着B箱里有钻石。实验表明，被要求说出印刷图片颜色的受试者，如果看到用红色墨水印着“GREEN”这个词，常常会说“绿色”而不是“红色”。如果你是文盲，反而不会被墨迹的形状迷惑。

对我们来说，事物的真正意义在于它与其他事物的纠缠。再想想那许多世界、分支。在所有聪明辩手都把墨水写在纸底部的那一刻——假设这是同一时刻——墨水与箱子的相关性就已经固定了。聪明辩手用不可擦的笔写字；墨水不会改变，箱子也不会改变。在那些纸上写着“所以，B箱里有钻石”的世界子集中，A箱里有钻石的世界比例已经是固定的。无论上面空白处再写什么，这个比例都不会改变。

所以，墨水的证据纠缠已经固定，至于它到底意味着什么，留给你自己判断。也许更有信心的箱主更愿意雇广告人，也许自知理亏的箱主会出更高价。如果箱主们自己都不懂这些迹象和征兆，那么墨水和箱子内容就完全无关，最多只能反映箱主的财力和竞价习惯。

现在，假设在场的另一个人是真正好奇的，他会先把两个箱子的所有不同迹象都写在纸上，然后运用自己的知识和概率法则，在底部写下：“因此，我估计B箱有钻石的概率为85%。”这份笔迹是哪些事实的证据？追溯导致这行墨水出现在纸上的因果链，我们会发现，这条因果链穿过了所有箱子的迹象和征兆，并依赖于这些迹象；因为在不同迹象的世界里，底部写下的概率也会不同。

所以，好奇者的笔迹与迹象、征兆和箱子内容纠缠在一起，而聪明辩手的笔迹只与哪个箱主出价高有关。两者的墨迹意义大不相同，虽然如果你只是机械地朗读这些墨迹，可能觉得英文单词听起来差不多。

你作为理性主义者的有效性，取决于到底是哪种算法在写下你思维的“结论”。如果你的车刹车时发出金属尖叫声，而你不愿面对修理刹车的经济代价，你可以选择去找各种理由证明车其实不用修。但你在埃弗雷特分支或泰格马克多重宇宙中存活下来的比例——我们就用这个来衡量你作为理性主义者的有效性——其实取决于你决定要为哪个结论寻找论据的算法。在这个例子里，真正的算法是“永远不修昂贵的东西”。如果这个算法好，那很好；如果不好，那也没办法。你之后写在“结论”上方的所有论据，都不会改变任何结果。

这段话的目的是提醒你自己思考时要警惕，而不是给你一个“万能反驳”去否定你不喜欢的结论。因为说“我的对手只是个聪明的辩手”本身也是一种巧妙的辩解，如果你只是想保留自己原有的信念。世界上最聪明的辩手也可能指出“太阳在照耀”，但白天依然很可能是真的。

## The Bottom Line

There are two sealed boxes up for auction, box A and box B. One and only one of these boxes contains a valuable diamond. There are all manner of signs and portents indicating whether a box contains a diamond; but I have no sign which I know to be perfectly reliable. There is a blue stamp on one box, for example, and I know that boxes which contain diamonds are more likely than empty boxes to show a blue stamp. Or one box has a shiny surface, and I have a suspicion—I am not sure—that no diamond-containing box is ever shiny.

Now suppose there is a clever arguer, holding a sheet of paper, and they say to the owners of box A and box B: “Bid for my services, and whoever wins my services, I shall argue that their box contains the diamond, so that the box will receive a higher price.” So the box-owners bid, and box B’s owner bids higher, winning the services of the clever arguer.

The clever arguer begins to organize their thoughts. First, they write, “And therefore, box B contains the diamond!” at the bottom of their sheet of paper. Then, at the top of the paper, the clever arguer writes, “Box B shows a blue stamp,” and beneath it, “Box A is shiny,” and then, “Box B is lighter than box A,” and so on through many signs and portents; yet the clever arguer neglects all those signs which might argue in favor of box A. And then the clever arguer comes to me and recites from their sheet of paper: “Box B shows a blue stamp, and box A is shiny,” and so on, until they reach: “and therefore, box B contains the diamond.”

But consider: At the moment when the clever arguer wrote down their conclusion, at the moment they put ink on their sheet of paper, the evidential entanglement of that physical ink with the physical boxes became fixed.

It may help to visualize a collection of worlds—Everett branches or Tegmark duplicates—within which there is some objective frequency at which box A or box B contains a diamond.<sup>1</sup>

The ink on paper is formed into odd shapes and curves, which look like this text: “And therefore, box B contains the diamond.” If you happened to be a literate English speaker, you might become confused, and think that this shaped ink somehow meant that box B contained the diamond. Subjects instructed to say the color of printed pictures and shown the word GREEN in red ink often say “green” instead of “red.” It helps to be illiterate, so that you are not confused by the shape of the ink.

To us, the true import of a thing is its entanglement with other things. Consider again the collection of worlds, Everett branches or Tegmark duplicates. At the moment when all clever arguers in all worlds put ink to the bottom line of their paper—let us suppose this is a single moment—it fixed the correlation of the ink with the boxes. The clever arguer writes in non-erasable pen; the ink will not change. The boxes will not change. Within the subset of worlds where the ink says “And therefore, box B contains the diamond,” there is already some fixed percentage of worlds where box A contains the diamond. This will not change regardless of what is written in on the blank lines above.

So the evidential entanglement of the ink is fixed, and I leave to you to decide what it might be. Perhaps box owners who believe a better case can be made for them are more liable to hire advertisers; perhaps box owners who fear their own deficiencies bid higher. If the box owners do not themselves understand the signs and portents, then the ink will be completely unentangled with the boxes’ contents, though it may tell you something about the owners’ finances and bidding habits.

Now suppose another person present is genuinely curious, and they first write down all the distinguishing signs of both boxes on a sheet of paper, and then apply their knowledge and the laws of probability and write down at the bottom: “Therefore, I estimate an 85% probability that box B contains the diamond.” Of what is this handwriting evidence? Examining the chain of cause and effect leading to this physical ink on physical paper, I find that the chain of causality wends its way through all the signs and portents of the boxes, and is dependent on these signs; for in worlds with different portents, a different probability is written at the bottom.

So the handwriting of the curious inquirer is entangled with the signs and portents and the contents of the boxes, whereas the handwriting of the clever arguer is evidence only of which owner paid the higher bid. There is a great difference in the indications of ink, though one who foolishly read aloud the ink-shapes might think the English words sounded similar.

Your effectiveness as a rationalist is determined by whichever algorithm actually writes the bottom line of your thoughts. If your car makes metallic squealing noises when you brake, and you aren’t willing to face up to the financial cost of getting your brakes replaced, you can decide to look for reasons why your car might not need fixing. But the actual percentage of you that survive in Everett branches or Tegmark worlds—which we will take to describe your effectiveness as a rationalist—is determined by the algorithm that decided which conclusion you would seek arguments for. In this case, the real algorithm is “Never repair anything expensive.” If this is a good algorithm, fine; if this is a bad algorithm, oh well. The arguments you write afterward, above the bottom line, will not change anything either way.

This is intended as a caution for your own thinking, not a Fully General Counterargument against conclusions you don’t like. For it is indeed a clever argument to say “My opponent is a clever arguer,” if you are paying yourself to retain whatever beliefs you had at the start. The world’s cleverest arguer may point out that the Sun is shining, and yet it is still probably daytime.
