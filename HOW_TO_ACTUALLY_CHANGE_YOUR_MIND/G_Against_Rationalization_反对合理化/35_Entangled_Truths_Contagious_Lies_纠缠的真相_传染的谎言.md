## 纠缠的真相，传染的谎言

　　你们最早的一位哲学家得出结论：一个完全称职的心智，只要研究某个宇宙中的一个事实或一件物品，就能构建或想象出那个宇宙，从其诞生到最终终结的全过程……
　　——《第一透镜使》

　　你们中任何一个人，只要专注于一个单一事实，或一个小物体，比如一块鹅卵石或一种植物的种子，哪怕只是一百年，你就会开始感知到它的真相。
　　——《灰色透镜使》

我基本可以确定，从地球某片海滩上捡起的一块鹅卵石，并不能决定地球的大陆、国家、政治和人民。宇宙中其他星球、其他时空、其他埃弗雷特分支，也可能产生同样的鹅卵石。

另一方面，一块鹅卵石的身份似乎包含了我们的物理定律。从这个意义上说，我们整个宇宙——所有的埃弗雷特分支——都被这块鹅卵石所蕴含。<sup>1</sup>

通过研究这块鹅卵石，你可以看到物理定律及其所有推论。思考这些物理定律，你会知道行星会形成，也能猜到鹅卵石来自某颗行星。鹅卵石内部的晶体和分子结构是在重力作用下形成的，这告诉你关于行星质量的信息；鹅卵石的元素组成则透露了行星的形成过程。

我不是地质学家，不知道地质学家能洞悉哪些奥秘。但我很容易想象，把一块鹅卵石递给地质学家，说：“这块鹅卵石来自半月湾的海滩。”地质学家立刻说：“我很困惑。”甚至说：“你在撒谎。”也许是岩石类型不对，或者鹅卵石磨损程度不足以来自海滩——我对鹅卵石了解不够，无法猜到哪些线索会暴露我，这正是关键所在。

“只有上帝才能说出真正可信的谎言。”我想知道，是否有哪个宗教把这句话当作谚语？我（可证伪地）猜想没有：这其实是一种理性主义者的感慨，即便你用神学隐喻来表达。说“万物彼此相连，因为上帝创造并维系了整个世界”，在布道时也许能带来温暖的感觉，但在分辨鹅卵石属于哪片海滩时并没有什么用。

地球上的一分钱对月球施加的引力加速度约为 4.5 × 10⁻³¹ m/s²，从某种意义上说，说“每个事件都与其整个过去的光锥纠缠在一起”也不算错。由于推理可以在因果网络中前后传播，认知上的纠缠很容易跨越光锥的边界。但我可不想当那个要通过观察月亮来判断硬币正反面的天文法医——这种影响远小于量子不确定性和热噪声。

如果你说，“万物皆有纠缠”，或者“万物在推理上都纠缠在一起，只是有些纠缠远比其他更强”，那你也许是真的智慧，而不是装深沉。

在物理层面，每个事件在某种意义上都是其整个过去光锥的总和，没有边界。但可感知的纠缠清单要短得多，它呈现出类似网络的结构。这种高层次的规律，就是我所说的“大因果网”。

我用这些大写字母多少有点调侃；但如果有什么值得大写字母，那“大因果网”肯定榜上有名。

正如沃尔特·司各特所说：“我们初学欺骗时，编织的网会越来越乱。”并不是所有谎言都会失控——我们并不生活在那么正义的宇宙。但有时，某人撒了一个谎，就不得不为与之纠缠的事实再撒一个谎，然后又为下一个纠缠的事实再撒一个谎：

　　“你去哪儿了？”

　　“哦，我出差了。”

　　“出差是干什么的？”

　　“这个不能说，是和大客户的保密谈判。”

　　“哦——他们让你参与了？好消息！我应该打电话感谢你老板让你加入。”

　　“抱歉——他现在不在办公室……”

人类不是神，往往无法想象要编造一个真正可信的谎言，需要歪曲多少事实。“上帝让我怀孕”在过去听起来也许更可信，因为那时我们的世界模型还没有（关于）Y染色体的知识。如今，类似的谎言可能会在基因检测普及后被揭穿。强奸犯被定罪、诬告者被揭穿，往往是因为他们没意识到自己会留下证据。进化生物学的学生能在每只追兔子的狼、每只逃跑的兔子、每只蜇人的蜜蜂身上看到自然选择的设计印记；但我相信，创世论者的谎言在他们自己听来也很合理。

不是所有谎言都会被揭穿，不是所有说谎者都会被惩罚；我们并不生活在那么正义的宇宙。但也不是所有谎言都像说谎者想象的那样安全。我很好奇，如果有一个贝叶斯超级智能，用（无损的？）纳米技术扫描地球，会揭露多少罪行？至少，所有还有证据留存在任何大脑中的谎言都会暴露。如果神经科学家真的能用神经影像造出一个很棒的测谎仪，有些谎言可能会更早暴露。Paul Ekman（微表情研究先驱）如果有机会，恐怕现在就能识破世界上相当一部分谎言。

不是所有谎言都会被揭穿，不是所有说谎者都会被惩罚。但“大因果网”的复杂程度常常被低估。仅仅是人类已经积累的知识，就需要许多人类寿命才能学完。任何认为非神者能无风险地说出完美谎言的人，都低估了大因果网的纠缠程度。

诚实是最好的策略吗？我不敢说那么绝对：即使按我的伦理观，有时候闭嘴也是可以的。但和赤裸裸的谎言相比，无论是诚实还是沉默，都更少暴露于那些你未曾意识到的递归风险之下。

## Entangled Truths, Contagious Lies

	One of your very early philosophers came to the conclusion that a fully competent mind, from a study of one fact or artifact belonging to any given universe, could construct or visualize that universe, from the instant of its creation to its ultimate end . . .
	—First Lensman

	If any one of you will concentrate upon one single fact, or small object, such as a pebble or the seed of a plant or other creature, for as short a period of time as one hundred of your years, you will begin to perceive its truth.
	—Gray Lensman

I am reasonably sure that a single pebble, taken from a beach of our own Earth, does not specify the continents and countries, politics and people of this Earth. Other planets in space and time, other Everett branches, would generate the same pebble.

On the other hand, the identity of a single pebble would seem to include our laws of physics. In that sense the entirety of our Universe—all the Everett branches—would be implied by the pebble.<sup>1</sup>

From the study of that single pebble you could see the laws of physics and all they imply. Thinking about those laws of physics, you can see that planets will form, and you can guess that the pebble came from such a planet. The internal crystals and molecular formations of the pebble developed under gravity, which tells you something about the planet’s mass; the mix of elements in the pebble tells you something about the planet’s formation.

I am not a geologist, so I don’t know to which mysteries geologists are privy. But I find it very easy to imagine showing a geologist a pebble, and saying, “This pebble came from a beach at Half Moon Bay,” and the geologist immediately says, “I’m confused,” or even, “You liar.” Maybe it’s the wrong kind of rock, or the pebble isn’t worn enough to be from a beach—I don’t know pebbles well enough to guess the linkages and signatures by which I might be caught, which is the point.

“Only God can tell a truly plausible lie.” I wonder if there was ever a religion that developed this as a proverb? I would (falsifiably) guess not: it’s a rationalist sentiment, even if you cast it in theological metaphor. Saying “everything is interconnected to everything else, because God made the whole world and sustains it” may generate some nice warm ’n’ fuzzy feelings during the sermon, but it doesn’t get you very far when it comes to assigning pebbles to beaches.

A penny on Earth exerts a gravitational acceleration on the Moon of around 4.5 × 10−31 m/s2, so in one sense it’s not too far wrong to say that every event is entangled with its whole past light cone. And since inferences can propagate backward and forward through causal networks, epistemic entanglements can easily cross the borders of light cones. But I wouldn’t want to be the forensic astronomer who had to look at the Moon and figure out whether the penny landed heads or tails—the influence is far less than quantum uncertainty and thermal noise.

If you said, “Everything is entangled with something else,” or, “Everything is inferentially entangled and some entanglements are much stronger than others,” you might be really wise instead of just Deeply Wise.

Physically, each event is in some sense the sum of its whole past light cone, without borders or boundaries. But the list of noticeable entanglements is much shorter, and it gives you something like a network. This high-level regularity is what I refer to when I talk about the Great Web of Causality.

I use these Capitalized Letters somewhat tongue-in-cheek, perhaps; but if anything at all is worth Capitalized Letters, surely the Great Web of Causality makes the list.

“Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practise to deceive,” said Sir Walter Scott. Not all lies spin out of control—we don’t live in so righteous a universe. But it does occasionally happen that someone lies about a fact, and then has to lie about an entangled fact, and then another fact entangled with that one:

	“Where were you?”

	“Oh, I was on a business trip.”

	“What was the business trip about?”

	“I can’t tell you that; it’s proprietary negotiations with a major client.”

	“Oh—they’re letting you in on those? Good news! I should call your boss to thank him for adding you.”

	“Sorry—he’s not in the office right now . . .”

Human beings, who are not gods, often fail to imagine all the facts they would need to distort to tell a truly plausible lie. “God made me pregnant” sounded a tad more likely in the old days before our models of the world contained (quotations of) Y chromosomes. Many similar lies, today, may blow up when genetic testing becomes more common. Rapists have been convicted, and false accusers exposed, years later, based on evidence they didn’t realize they could leave. A student of evolutionary biology can see the design signature of natural selection on every wolf that chases a rabbit; and every rabbit that runs away; and every bee that stings instead of broadcasting a polite warning—but the deceptions of creationists sound plausible to them, I’m sure.

Not all lies are uncovered, not all liars are punished; we don’t live in that righteous a universe. But not all lies are as safe as their liars believe. How many sins would become known to a Bayesian superintelligence, I wonder, if it did a (non-destructive?) nanotechnological scan of the Earth? At minimum, all the lies of which any evidence still exists in any brain. Some such lies may become known sooner than that, if the neuroscientists ever succeed in building a really good lie detector via neuroimaging. Paul Ekman (a pioneer in the study of tiny facial muscle movements) could probably read off a sizeable fraction of the world’s lies right now, given a chance.

Not all lies are uncovered, not all liars are punished. But the Great Web is very commonly underestimated. Just the knowledge that humans have already accumulated would take many human lifetimes to learn. Anyone who thinks that a non-God can tell a perfect lie, risk-free, is underestimating the tangledness of the Great Web.

Is honesty the best policy? I don’t know if I’d go that far: Even on my ethics, it’s sometimes okay to shut up. But compared to outright lies, either honesty or silence involves less exposure to recursively propagating risks you don’t know you’re taking.
