## 避开信仰真正的薄弱点

几年前，我的曾祖母去世了，享年九十多岁，经历了漫长、缓慢而残酷的衰败。我并不了解她这个人，但在我遥远的童年里，她曾为家人做饭；我记得她做的鱼冻，记得她的面容，记得她对我很温柔。在她的葬礼上，我的叔公——这些年一直照顾她——发表了讲话。他哽咽着说，上帝一点一点地把他的母亲带走：先是记忆，然后是语言，最后是她的微笑；当上帝最终带走她的微笑时，他就知道她离死不远了，因为这意味着她几乎已经完全消失了。

我听到这些时感到困惑，因为这对任何人来说都是难以想象的可怕事情，因此我本不指望叔公会把这归因于上帝。通常，犹太人会下意识地不去思考“上帝允许悲剧发生”这个逻辑后果。按犹太教神学，上帝持续维系宇宙，并选择其中的每一个事件；但通常只有在喜事时才会主动说“是上帝做的！”——比如得了个女儿。而对于流产、死胎、婴儿猝死，人们则会下意识地不去想“是上帝做的！”这样你就能为你的上帝建立起一个极其片面的仁慈形象。

因此，当我听到叔公把母亲的缓慢衰亡归因于上帝有意为之、精心策划时，我很惊讶。这违背了我所理解的宗教自欺的规则。

如果当时我注意到自己的困惑，我本可以做出一个成功的惊人预测。不久之后，我的叔公就离开了犹太教。（据我所知，除了我之外，他是我大家族中唯一这样做的人。）

现代正统犹太教和我听说过的任何其他宗教都不一样，我也不知道该怎么向没被迫学习过米示拿和塔木德的人描述它。这里有质疑的传统，但那种质疑……你完全不会惊讶地听到拉比在每周讲道时指出创世七日和宇宙大爆炸后137亿年之间的冲突——因为他自以为有个很巧妙的解释，涉及另外三个圣经典故、一个米德拉士和一篇半懂不懂的《科学美国人》文章。在正统犹太教中，你可以注意到矛盾和不一致，但只能用来解释掉它们，谁能编出最复杂的解释谁就获奖。

这里有探究的传统。但你攻击目标只是为了防守。你只攻击那些你知道自己能防守住的目标。

在现代正统犹太教中，我很少听到强调盲目信仰的美德。你可以怀疑。你只是不能成功地怀疑。

我猜，大多数受过教育的正统犹太人一生中都曾质疑过自己的信仰。但这种质疑大概是这样的：“怀疑论者说，托拉写着宇宙是七天创造的，这不科学。但如果把科学真相告诉西奈山下的以色列部落，他们能理解吗？他们甚至有‘十亿’这个词吗？把七天的故事当作隐喻更容易——首先上帝创造了光，这代表大爆炸……”

这真的是攻击犹太教最薄弱的地方吗？再往后读读托拉，你会发现上帝杀死了埃及所有头生男婴，只为说服一个没有选举产生的法老释放奴隶——而这些奴隶其实完全可以被瞬间传送出国。正统犹太人当然熟悉这个故事，因为他们每年都要在会堂里通读整本托拉，而且这个事件还有一个重要的节日。逾越节（Pesach）这个名字就来自于上帝在杀死埃及所有头生男婴时“越过”了犹太人的家。

现代正统犹太人大多是善良而文明的人，比旧约的几位编者文明多了。连古代的拉比都更文明。逾越节仪式里有个环节，要从酒杯里滴出十滴酒，每滴对应十灾，以此强调埃及人的苦难。（当然，你应该同情埃及人的苦难，但不能同情到站起来说“这不对！这样做是错的！”）这形成了有趣的对比——拉比们比旧约编者更有同情心，能看到灾难的残酷。但在那个年代，科学还不发达，所以拉比们可以思考经文中那些令人不快的部分，而不用担心信仰会因此彻底崩溃。

你甚至不会去问这个事件是否让上帝形象变差，所以也就不需要赶紧说“上帝的道路高深莫测！”、“我们不够智慧，不能质疑上帝的决定！”或者“杀婴只要是上帝做的就没问题！”这部分问题根本就不会被想起。

我怀疑，受过教育的宗教人士之所以能保持信仰，是因为当他们怀疑时，会下意识地非常小心，只在最强的地方攻击自己的信仰——那些他们知道自己能防守住的地方。而且，反复演练标准的辩护会让他们感觉更强大。

比如，反复演练“科学不是说宇宙只是毫无意义的原子乱撞吗？”的标准答辩，能让人确认宇宙的意义来自上帝等等，这种感觉一定很棒。比起想象一个文盲的埃及母亲在被杀的儿子的摇篮旁哀号，这种思考要舒服得多。任何在质疑犹太教信仰时自发想到后者的人，才是真的在质疑信仰，而且很可能不会再信下去了。

我在这里的重点并不是批评正统犹太教。我相信关于杀长子的故事肯定有各种各样的解释，可能有十几种。我的重点是，在自发自我质疑时，人们更可能自发地攻击那些有安慰性答复的强点，而不是自发地攻击最薄弱、最脆弱的地方。同样，人们也更可能在第一个答复后就停下来获得安慰，而不是继续批判这个答复。比起“避开信仰真正的薄弱点”，更好的标题也许是“不会自发想到信仰最痛苦的弱点”。

最重要的是，宗教之所以能牢牢抓住人心，是因为人们就是不会去想宗教真正的薄弱点。我认为这不是训练的问题，而是本能。人们不去想信仰真正薄弱点的原因，和他们不会去碰烫红的炉灶一样：那很痛苦。

想要做得更好：当你怀疑自己最珍视的信念时，闭上眼睛，清空大脑，咬紧牙关，有意识地去想那些最让你痛苦的地方。不要反复演练那些有标准反驳、能让你感觉更好的常规异议。问问自己，那些聪明的反对者会如何反驳你的第一个答复、第二个答复。每当你发现自己在回避某个一闪而过的反对意见时，把它拉到脑海最前面。狠狠地给自己一拳，像刀子一样扎进心脏，然后扭一扭，把伤口撕大。面对痛苦，只需反复默念：<sup>1</sup>

　　真实的东西已经如此。

　　承认它不会让事情变得更糟。

　　不坦然面对它也不会让它消失。

　　正因为它是真的，它才是你必须面对的现实。

　　虚假的东西并不存在，无法真正生活其中。

　　人们可以承受真实，因为他们已经在承受它了。

## Avoiding Your Belief’s Real Weak Points

A few years back, my great-grandmother died, in her nineties, after a long, slow, and cruel disintegration. I never knew her as a person, but in my distant childhood, she cooked for her family; I remember her gefilte fish, and her face, and that she was kind to me. At her funeral, my grand-uncle, who had taken care of her for years, spoke. He said, choking back tears, that God had called back his mother piece by piece: her memory, and her speech, and then finally her smile; and that when God finally took her smile, he knew it wouldn’t be long before she died, because it meant that she was almost entirely gone.

I heard this and was puzzled, because it was an unthinkably horrible thing to happen to anyone, and therefore I would not have expected my grand-uncle to attribute it to God. Usually, a Jew would somehow justnot-think-about the logical implication that God had permitted a tragedy. According to Jewish theology, God continually sustains the universe and chooses every event in it; but ordinarily, drawing logical implications from this belief is reserved for happier occasions. By saying “God did it!” only when you’ve been blessed with a baby girl, and just-not-thinking “God did it!” for miscarriages and stillbirths and crib deaths, you can build up quite a lopsided picture of your God’s benevolent personality.

Hence I was surprised to hear my grand-uncle attributing the slow disintegration of his mother to a deliberate, strategically planned act of God. It violated the rules of religious self-deception as I understood them.

If I had noticed my own confusion, I could have made a successful surprising prediction. Not long afterward, my grand-uncle left the Jewish religion. (The only member of my extended family besides myself to do so, as far as I know.)

Modern Orthodox Judaism is like no other religion I have ever heard of, and I don’t know how to describe it to anyone who hasn’t been forced to study Mishna and Gemara. There is a tradition of questioning, but the kind of questioning . . . It would not be at all surprising to hear a rabbi, in his weekly sermon, point out the conflict between the seven days of creation and the 13.7 billion years since the Big Bang—because he thought he had a really clever explanation for it, involving three other Biblical references, a Midrash, and a half-understood article in Scientific American. In Orthodox Judaism you’re allowed to notice inconsistencies and contradictions, but only for purposes of explaining them away, and whoever comes up with the most complicated explanation gets a prize.

There is a tradition of inquiry. But you only attack targets for purposes of defending them. You only attack targets you know you can defend.

In Modern Orthodox Judaism I have not heard much emphasis of the virtues of blind faith. You’re allowed to doubt. You’re just not allowed to successfully doubt.

I expect that the vast majority of educated Orthodox Jews have questioned their faith at some point in their lives. But the questioning probably went something like this: “According to the skeptics, the Torah says that the universe was created in seven days, which is not scientifically accurate. But would the original tribespeople of Israel, gathered at Mount Sinai, have been able to understand the scientific truth, even if it had been presented to them? Did they even have a word for ‘billion’? It’s easier to see the seven-days story as a metaphor—first God created light, which represents the Big Bang . . .”

Is this the weakest point at which to attack one’s own Judaism? Read a bit further on in the Torah, and you can find God killing the first-born male children of Egypt to convince an unelected Pharaoh to release slaves who logically could have been teleported out of the country. An Orthodox Jew is most certainly familiar with this episode, because they are supposed to read through the entire Torah in synagogue once per year, and this event has an associated major holiday. The name “Passover” (“Pesach”) comes from God passing over the Jewish households while killing every male firstborn in Egypt.

Modern Orthodox Jews are, by and large, kind and civilized people; far more civilized than the several editors of the Old Testament. Even the old rabbis were more civilized. There’s a ritual in the Seder where you take ten drops of wine from your cup, one drop for each of the Ten Plagues, to emphasize the suffering of the Egyptians. (Of course, you’re supposed to be sympathetic to the suffering of the Egyptians, but not so sympathetic that you stand up and say, “This is not right! It is wrong to do such a thing!”) It shows an interesting contrast—the rabbis were sufficiently kinder than the compilers of the Old Testament that they saw the harshness of the Plagues. But Science was weaker in these days, and so rabbis could ponder the more unpleasant aspects of Scripture without fearing that it would break their faith entirely.

You don’t even ask whether the incident reflects poorly on God, so there’s no need to quickly blurt out “The ways of God are mysterious!” or “We’re not wise enough to question God’s decisions!” or “Murdering babies is okay when God does it!” That part of the question is just-not-thoughtabout.

The reason that educated religious people stay religious, I suspect, is that when they doubt, they are subconsciously very careful to attack their own beliefs only at the strongest points—places where they know they can defend. Moreover, places where rehearsing the standard defense will feel strengthening.

It probably feels really good, for example, to rehearse one’s prescripted defense for “Doesn’t Science say that the universe is just meaningless atoms bopping around?” because it confirms the meaning of the universe and how it flows from God, etc. Much more comfortable to think about than an illiterate Egyptian mother wailing over the crib of her slaughtered son. Anyone who spontaneously thinks about the latter, when questioning their faith in Judaism, is really questioning it, and is probably not going to stay Jewish much longer.

My point here is not just to beat up on Orthodox Judaism. I’m sure that there’s some reply or other for the Slaying of the Firstborn, and probably a dozen of them. My point is that, when it comes to spontaneous selfquestioning, one is much more likely to spontaneously self-attack strong points with comforting replies to rehearse, than to spontaneously self-attack the weakest, most vulnerable points. Similarly, one is likely to stop at the first reply and be comforted, rather than further criticizing the reply. A better title than “Avoiding Your Belief’s Real Weak Points” would be “Not Spontaneously Thinking About Your Belief’s Most Painful Weaknesses.”

More than anything, the grip of religion is sustained by people just-notthinking-about the real weak points of their religion. I don’t think this is a matter of training, but a matter of instinct. People don’t think about the real weak points of their beliefs for the same reason they don’t touch an oven’s red-hot burners; it’s painful.

To do better: When you’re doubting one of your most cherished beliefs, close your eyes, empty your mind, grit your teeth, and deliberately think about whatever hurts the most. Don’t rehearse standard objections whose standard counters would make you feel better. Ask yourself what smart people who disagree would say to your first reply, and your second reply. Whenever you catch yourself flinching away from an objection you fleetingly thought of, drag it out into the forefront of your mind. Punch yourself in the solar plexus. Stick a knife in your heart, and wiggle to widen the hole. In the face of the pain, rehearse only this:<sup>1</sup>

	What is true is already so.

	Owning up to it doesn’t make it worse.

	Not being open about it doesn’t make it go away.

	And because it’s true, it is what is there to be interacted with.

	Anything untrue isn’t there to be lived.

	People can stand what is true, for they are already enduring it.
