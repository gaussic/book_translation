## 一个理性的论证

你的职业是一名竞选经理，你刚刚被哈德利堡市长候选人、绿党成员莫蒂默·Q·斯诺德格拉斯雇佣。作为一名正在阅读理性书籍的竞选经理，你最关心的问题是：“我如何才能构建一个无懈可击的理性论证，证明莫蒂默·Q·斯诺德格拉斯是哈德利堡市长的最佳人选？”

很抱歉，这做不到。

“什么？”你喊道，“但如果我只用有效的支持来构建我的推理结构呢？如果我引用的每一个事实都是我所知范围内的真相，并且根据贝叶斯法则引用了相关证据呢？”<sup>1</sup>

很抱歉，还是做不到。只要你提前指定了论证的结论，你就已经输了。

今年，《哈德利堡号角报》向所有市长候选人发出了一份包含16个问题的问卷，问题包括“你能用风的所有颜色作画吗？”和“你吸过吗？”可惜的是，号角报的办公室在发表前被一颗陨石摧毁了。很遗憾，因为你自己的候选人莫蒂默·Q·斯诺德格拉斯在16个问题中有15个都比对手表现得更好。唯一的问题是第11题：“你现在，或者曾经，是超级反派吗？”

于是你很想把这份问卷作为竞选材料发布……当然，第11题要删掉。

这就跨越了理性与合理化的界限。选民们已经无法仅仅根据事实本身来判断，他们还必须考虑这些事实是如何被呈现的，并推断出有隐藏证据的存在。

事实上，你在决定是否发布问卷之前，考虑这份问卷对你的候选人是有利还是不利时，就已经越界了。“什么！”你喊道，“竞选团队难道还要发布对自己候选人不利的事实？”但请把自己放在选民的位置上，仍在努力选择候选人——你为什么要屏蔽有用的信息？如果你真的好奇，就不会这样做。如果你是从证据出发，朝着未知的候选人选择前进，而不是从一个既定的候选人出发，反向寻找论据。

“逻辑”论证是指从前提推导出结论。因此，下面这个论证是不合逻辑的：

- 所有矩形都是四边形。
- 所有正方形都是四边形。
- 所以，所有正方形都是矩形。

这个三段论并不会因为前提为真，甚至结论为真而变得合逻辑。区分逻辑推理和非逻辑推理是有意义的，即使结论碰巧是真的，也不能为其开脱。一方面，这种区分会影响我们在面对未来证据时如何修正信念。另一方面，马虎会成为习惯。

最重要的是，这个三段论没有说明真正的解释。也许所有正方形都是矩形，但如果是的话，原因并不是因为它们都是四边形。你可以称之为“伪善三段论”——表面理由和真实理由之间并不一致。

如果你真的想在政治竞选中为你的候选人提出一个诚实、理性的论证，只有一种方法：

- 在任何人雇佣你之前，收集关于所有候选人的所有证据。
- 制作一份你自己用来判断哪个候选人最好的清单。
- 按照清单进行评估。
- 去找胜出的候选人。
- 提出成为他们的竞选经理。
- 当他们需要竞选材料时，把你的清单打印出来。

只有这样，你才能提供一条理性的论证链——其结论是由上面的证据正向推导出来的。无论真正决定你结论的是什么，只有那些才是你可以诚实地写在上面的内容。

## A Rational Argument

You are, by occupation, a campaign manager, and you’ve just been hired by Mortimer Q. Snodgrass, the Green candidate for Mayor of Hadleyburg. As a campaign manager reading a book on rationality, one question lies foremost on your mind: “How can I construct an impeccable rational argument that Mortimer Q. Snodgrass is the best candidate for Mayor of Hadleyburg?”

Sorry. It can’t be done.

“What?” you cry. “But what if I use only valid support to construct my structure of reason? What if every fact I cite is true to the best of my knowledge, and relevant evidence under Bayes’s Rule?”<sup>1</sup>

Sorry. It still can’t be done. You defeated yourself the instant you specified your argument’s conclusion in advance.

This year, the Hadleyburg Trumpet sent out a 16-item questionnaire to all mayoral candidates, with questions like “Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?” and “Did you inhale?” Alas, the Trumpet’s offices are destroyed by a meteorite before publication. It’s a pity, since your own candidate, Mortimer Q. Snodgrass, compares well to his opponents on 15 out of 16 questions. The only sticking point was Question 11, “Are you now, or have you ever been, a supervillain?”

So you are tempted to publish the questionnaire as part of your own campaign literature . . . with the 11th question omitted, of course.

Which crosses the line between rationality and rationalization. It is no longer possible for the voters to condition on the facts alone; they must con- dition on the additional fact of their presentation, and infer the existence of hidden evidence.

Indeed, you crossed the line at the point where you considered whether the questionnaire was favorable or unfavorable to your candidate, before deciding whether to publish it. “What!” you cry. “A campaign should publish facts unfavorable to their candidate?” But put yourself in the shoes of a voter, still trying to select a candidate—why would you censor useful information? You wouldn’t, if you were genuinely curious. If you were flowing forward from the evidence to an unknown choice of candidate, rather than flowing backward from a fixed candidate to determine the arguments.

A “logical” argument is one that follows from its premises. Thus the following argument is illogical:

• All rectangles are quadrilaterals.
• All squares are quadrilaterals.
• Therefore, all squares are rectangles.

This syllogism is not rescued from illogic by the truth of its premises or even the truth of its conclusion. It is worth distinguishing logical deductions from illogical ones, and to refuse to excuse them even if their conclusions happen to be true. For one thing, the distinction may affect how we revise our beliefs in light of future evidence. For another, sloppiness is habit- forming.

Above all, the syllogism fails to state the real explanation. Maybe all squares are rectangles, but, if so, it’s not because they are both quadrilaterals. You might call it a hypocritical syllogism—one with a disconnect between its stated reasons and real reasons.

If you really want to present an honest, rational argument for your candi- date, in a political campaign, there is only one way to do it:

• Before anyone hires you, gather up all the evidence you can about the different candidates.
• Make a checklist which you, yourself, will use to decide which candi- date seems best.
• Process the checklist.
• Go to the winning candidate.
• Offer to become their campaign manager.
• When they ask for campaign literature, print out your checklist.

Only in this way can you offer a rational chain of argument, one whose bottom line was written flowing forward from the lines above it. Whatever actually decides your bottom line is the only thing you can honestly write on the lines above.
