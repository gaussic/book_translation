## 那真的是你拒绝的真正理由吗？

有时候，有人遇到我那些超人类主义方面的信念——与我关于人类理性相关的观点不同——比如超级智能、友好型人工智能等听起来奇怪、异想天开的想法，然后他们就拒绝了这些观点。

如果有人被要求解释自己为什么拒绝，常常会说：“我为什么要相信 Yudkowsky 说的话？他连博士学位都没有！”

偶尔，也会有人听到后说：“哦，你应该去拿个博士学位，这样大家才会听你的。”有时甚至是同一个表示怀疑的人会说：“等你有了博士学位再来吧。”

当然，读博士有好理由，也有坏理由。这就是一个坏理由。

其实，人们对超人类主义论题产生初步反感的原因有很多。大多数原因都属于模式识别，而不是语言思考：这些观点让人联想到“奇怪的怪异想法”“科幻小说”“世界末日邪教”或“过于热情的年轻人”之类的类别。<sup>1</sup> 于是，几乎在感知的瞬间，这个想法就被拒绝了。

如果之后有人问“为什么不接受？”，这就会启动一个寻找理由的过程，但这个过程未必能找到真正的原因。这里的“真正理由”，不是指你能给出的最好的理由，而是指在你最初拒绝的那一刻，真正起决定作用的历史性原因。

但这个寻找理由的过程，往往会停在一个听起来像理由的事实上，比如“这个人没有博士学位”。可我在谈论人类理性时也没有博士学位，为什么那时没人提出同样的反对呢？

更重要的是，如果我有了博士学位，人们也不会因此就觉得应该相信我说的每一句话。相反，最初的拒绝依然会发生，理由还是一样；只是事后寻找理由的过程会停在另一个地方。

他们会说：“我为什么要相信你？你不过是个有博士学位的人！这样的人多了去了。等你在本领域成名、在著名大学拿到终身教职再说吧。”

但人们真的会相信哈佛的某个教授说的所有怪事吗？当然不会。

如果你说的话对外行听起来不对劲，而不是像在胡乱说什么“勒普缇夸克在 N+2 维空间纠缠”那样的魔法术语；而听众既不认识你本人，也不熟悉你的领域，那么我怀疑，单凭学术头衔让普通人真正改变初印象的门槛，大概得达到诺贝尔奖得主的级别。也许还不止如此。大致上，你需要那种“超越寻常”的学术资历。

据我所知，Eric Drexler 就遇到过类似的事。他提出了自己的纳米技术设想，人们说：“技术细节在哪里？”或者“等你有了博士学位再来！”于是 Drexler 花了六年写技术细节，并在 Marvin Minsky 指导下拿到了博士学位，还写出了很棒的《纳米系统》一书。但那些说“等你有了博士学位再来”的人，真的因此改变了对分子纳米技术的看法吗？据我所知，并没有。

这对年轻企业和新晋顾问来说可能很重要——你被拒绝时，对方给出的理由未必是真正的决定性因素；在你投入巨大努力之前，应该仔细思考这一点。如果风险投资人说：“要是你们的销售增长再快一点就好了！”或者潜在客户说：“产品不错，就是缺少 X 功能”，这未必是真正的拒绝理由。修正它，也许会有用，也许什么都不会变。

在争论时也要记住这一点。Robin Hanson 和我都相信，两个理性主义者不应该“同意不同意”：如果他们在认识论上有分歧并且彼此都知道，除非出了大问题，否则不该持续存在分歧。<sup>2</sup>

我怀疑，一般来说，如果两个理性主义者试图解决一次持续多轮的分歧，他们会发现分歧的真正根源要么难以表达，要么难以暴露。比如：

- 罕见但有充分支持的科学知识或数学；
- 推理距离太长；
- 难以用语言表达的直觉，可能源自具体的想象画面；
- 某个职业继承下来的时代精神（也许有其合理性）；
- 从经验中感知到的模式；
- 思维习惯；
- 对某种结果的情感承诺；
- 害怕过去的错误被推翻；
- 为了自尊或其他个人利益而深度自欺。

如果所有真正的拒绝理由都能轻松摆到桌面上，这个分歧大概早在第一次交流后就解决了。

“这真的是我拒绝的真正理由吗？”——这是所有争论双方都应该问自己的问题，这样能让对方更容易理解你。不过，从我见过的情况看，直接公开地对对方进行心理分析，往往会让对话迅速恶化。

尽管如此，如果有建设性的方式推进这个子议题，“那真的是你拒绝的真正理由吗？”这个问题还是可以谦逊地提出。也许可以有个规则：你可以公开问，“你刚才说的那个简单直接的理由，真的是你拒绝的真正理由吗？还是其实源自某种直觉 X 或职业时代精神 Y？”而那些更尴尬的可能性，就留给对方的良知，由他们自己处理。

## Is That Your True Rejection?

It happens every now and then that someone encounters some of my transhumanist-side beliefs—as opposed to my ideas having to do with human rationality—strange, exotic-sounding ideas like superintelligence and Friendly AI. And the one rejects them.

If the one is called upon to explain the rejection, not uncommonly the one says, “Why should I believe anything Yudkowsky says? He doesn’t have a PhD!”

And occasionally someone else, hearing, says, “Oh, you should get a PhD, so that people will listen to you.” Or this advice may even be offered by the same one who expressed disbelief, saying, “Come back when you have a PhD.”

Now, there are good and bad reasons to get a PhD. This is one of the bad ones.

There are many reasons why someone might actually have an initial adverse reaction to transhumanist theses. Most are matters of pattern recognition, rather than verbal thought: the thesis calls to mind an associated category like “strange weird idea” or “science fiction” or “end-of-the-world cult” or “overenthusiastic youth.”<sup>1</sup> Immediately, at the speed of perception, the idea is rejected.

If someone afterward says, “Why not?” this launches a search for justification, but the search won’t necessarily hit on the true reason. By “‘true reason,” I don’t mean the best reason that could be offered. Rather, I mean whichever causes were decisive as a matter of historical fact, at the very first moment the rejection occurred.

Instead, the search for justification hits on the justifying-sounding fact, “This speaker does not have a PhD.” But I also don’t have a PhD when I talk about human rationality, so why is the same objection not raised there?

More to the point, if I had a PhD, people would not treat this as a decisive factor indicating that they ought to believe everything I say. Rather, the same initial rejection would occur, for the same reasons; and the search for justification, afterward, would terminate at a different stopping point.

They would say, “Why should I believe you? You’re just some guy with a PhD! There are lots of those. Come back when you’re well-known in your field and tenured at a major university.”

But do people actually believe arbitrary professors at Harvard who say weird things? Of course not.

If you’re saying things that sound wrong to a novice, as opposed to just rattling off magical-sounding technobabble about leptical quark braids in N + 2 dimensions; and if the hearer is a stranger, unfamiliar with you personally and unfamiliar with the subject matter of your field; then I suspect that the point at which the average person will actually start to grant credence overriding their initial impression, purely because of academic credentials, is somewhere around the Nobel Laureate level. If that. Roughly, you need whatever level of academic credential qualifies as “beyond the mundane.”

This is more or less what happened to Eric Drexler, as far as I can tell. He presented his vision of nanotechnology, and people said, “Where are the technical details?” or “Come back when you have a PhD!” And Eric Drexler spent six years writing up technical details and got his PhD under Marvin Minsky for doing it. And Nanosystems is a great book. But did the same people who said, “Come back when you have a PhD,” actually change their minds at all about molecular nanotechnology? Not so far as I ever heard.

This might be an important thing for young businesses and new-minted consultants to keep in mind—that what your failed prospects tell you is the reason for rejection may not make the real difference; and you should ponder that carefully before spending huge efforts. If the venture capitalist says, “If only your sales were growing a little faster!” or if the potential customer says, “It seems good, but you don’t have feature X,” that may not be the true rejection. Fixing it may, or may not, change anything.

And it would also be something to keep in mind during disagreements. Robin Hanson and I share a belief that two rationalists should not agree to disagree: they should not have common knowledge of epistemic disagreement unless something is very wrong.<sup>2</sup>

I suspect that, in general, if two rationalists set out to resolve a disagreement that persisted past the first exchange, they should expect to find that the true sources of the disagreement are either hard to communicate, or hard to expose. E.g.:

• Uncommon, but well-supported, scientific knowledge or math;
• Long inferential distances;
• Hard-to-verbalize intuitions, perhaps stemming from specific visualizations;
• Zeitgeists inherited from a profession (that may have good reason for it);
• Patterns perceptually recognized from experience;
• Sheer habits of thought;
• Emotional commitments to believing in a particular outcome;
• Fear that a past mistake could be disproved;
• Deep self-deception for the sake of pride or other personal benefits.

If the matter were one in which all the true rejections could be easily laid on the table, the disagreement would probably be so straightforward to resolve that it would never have lasted past the first meeting.

“Is this my true rejection?” is something that both disagreers should surely be asking themselves, to make things easier on the other person. However, attempts to directly, publicly psychoanalyze the other may cause the conversation to degenerate very fast, from what I’ve seen.

Still—“Is that your true rejection?” should be fair game for Disagreers to humbly ask, if there’s any productive way to pursue that sub-issue. Maybe the rule could be that you can openly ask, “Is that simple straightforwardsounding reason your true rejection, or does it come from intuition-X or professional-zeitgeist-Y ?” While the more embarrassing possibilities lower on the table are left to the Other’s conscience, as their own responsibility to handle.
