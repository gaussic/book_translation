## 理性与英语语言

前几天，有人评论说我的写作让他们想起了乔治·奥威尔的《政治与英语语言》。<sup>1</sup> 我感到非常荣幸，尤其是因为我早就想写今天这个话题了。

如果你真的想从艺术家的角度理解理性，那就去读奥威尔吧；他不仅是作家，也是理性主义者的必读书目。奥威尔不是科学家，而是作家；他的工具不是数字，而是文字；他的对手不是大自然，而是人类的邪恶。如果你想把某人关进监狱多年却不给审判，你就不能直接说“我要把詹宁斯先生关进监狱多年且不给审判”。你必须换一种说法，让听众的思维变得模糊，让他们无法清晰地想象，从而避免良心的愤怒。你会说：“不可靠分子被交由替代性司法程序处理。”

奥威尔是极权主义及其用来掩盖邪恶的模糊思维的愤怒反对者——这也是为什么奥威尔关于语言的著作最终成为了理性主义经典文献，与费曼、萨根或道金斯齐名。

“作家被告知要避免使用被动语态。”一个只接受过科学训练的理性主义者可能看不出这句话的问题；但任何有点写作经验的人都会立刻发现。我刚才这句话就是被动语态，却没有告诉你是谁在告诫作者避免被动语态。被动语态抹去了行为者，只留下被作用的对象。“不可靠分子被交由替代性司法程序处理”——那是谁处理的？“替代性司法程序”到底做了什么？只要用足够多的静态名词短语，你就能让任何令人不快的事情都仿佛没有真正发生。

学术论文常常用被动语态。（抱歉，应该说“有些科学家用被动语态写论文”。论文又不是凭空自己写出来的，也不是没人负责。）说“受试者被给予了 Progenitorivox”听起来比“我给每个大学生一瓶 20 粒的 Progenitorivox，并告诉他们每天晚上吃一粒直到吃完”为权威得多。如果你把科学家从描述中抹去，就只剩下最重要的数据。但实际上，科学家确实在场，受试者就是大学生，Progenitorivox 不是“被给予”，而是被递过去并附带了说明。被动语态掩盖了现实。

从我收到的评论来看，有人会反驳说，在学术论文中用被动语态并不算什么罪——毕竟，只要你仔细想想，就能意识到科学家确实存在。这似乎不是逻辑上的错误。这也是为什么理性主义者不仅要读费曼，甚至不仅要读 Jaynes，还要读奥威尔。

非虚构作品传递知识，虚构作品传递体验。医学科学可以推断一个人在真空中会发生什么，小说则能让你亲身经历这一切。

有些理性主义者会试图分析误导性的短语，看看它是否可能有任何有意义的内容，试图构建一个合乎逻辑的解释。他们会很宽容，愿意给作者以善意的解释。而作家则受过训练，不会对自己宽容。无论观众理解成什么，那就是你说的话，不管你本意如何；你无法和观众争辩，无论你的辩解多么巧妙。

作家知道读者不会停下来思考一分钟。虚构体验是一连串的第一印象。作家型理性主义者会关注文字带来的体验。如果你在评估一句话的公共理性时，反复分析措辞、重组命题、尝试不同含义、寻找“真理感”的蛛丝马迹，那么你就会忽略第一印象——也就是观众看到、或者说感受到的东西。

小说家会立刻察觉到“受试者被给予了 Progenitorivox”这句话的荒谬。读者能从中体验到什么？这句话只营造了一种遥远的权威感，仅此而已——唯一的体验就是“被告知某事很可靠”的感觉。小说家会看到，这些名词太抽象，无法展现实际发生了什么——比如手里拿着药瓶、努力装出严肃表情的博士后，或者带着紧张笑容听讲的学生。

我的观点不是说学术论文应该像小说一样写，而是理性主义者应该有意识地觉察到文字所营造的体验。理性主义者必须理解大脑以及如何操作它。这包括意识流，也包括你用语言展开的那部分自我。理性主义者必须有意识地觉察短语的实际体验影响，而不仅仅是它们的命题语义。<sup>2</sup>

更直接地说：**意义不能为影响开脱！**

我不在乎你能为“人工智能应该通过民主程序开发”这种掌声口号构建出多么理性的解释。这无法为它的非理性影响开脱——它的作用就是让观众鼓掌，更不用说它本身含糊其辞、偷换概念。

奥威尔曾猛烈抨击陈词滥调的影响，以及它们对思维体验的作用：

    当你看到某个疲惫的政客在讲台上机械地重复那些熟悉的短语——“野兽般的暴行”“铁蹄”“血腥暴政”“世界自由人民”“肩并肩站立”——你常常会觉得，自己看到的不是一个活生生的人，而是某种木偶……使用这种措辞的演讲者，已经在某种程度上把自己变成了机器。合适的声音从他的喉咙里发出来，但大脑并没有参与，就像他自己选词时那样……

    最重要的是，要让意义选择词语，而不是反过来。在散文中，最糟糕的事就是屈服于词语。当你想到一个具体的事物时，你会无言地思考，然后，如果你想描述你所想象的东西，你大概会四处寻找最贴切的词语。当你想到抽象事物时，你更倾向于一开始就用词语，除非你有意识地阻止，否则现成的方言会蜂拥而至，替你完成表达，但代价是模糊甚至改变了你的本意。也许，最好尽量推迟用词语，先用图像和感受把意思弄清楚。

查尔斯·桑德斯·皮尔士也许会写出最后那一段。通往理性之道的路不止一条。

## Rationality and the English Language

The other day, someone commented that my writing reminded them of George Orwell’s “Politics and the English Language.”<sup>1</sup> I was honored. Especially since I’d already thought of today’s topic.

If you really want an artist’s perspective on rationality, then read Orwell; he is mandatory reading for rationalists as well as authors. Orwell was not a scientist, but a writer; his tools were not numbers, but words; his adversary was not Nature, but human evil. If you wish to imprison people for years without trial, you must think of some other way to say it than “I’m going to imprison Mr. Jennings for years without trial.” You must muddy the listener’s thinking, prevent clear images from outraging conscience. You say, “Unreliable elements were subjected to an alternative justice process.”

Orwell was the outraged opponent of totalitarianism and the muddy thinking in which evil cloaks itself—which is how Orwell’s writings on language ended up as classic rationalist documents on a level with Feynman, Sagan, or Dawkins.

“Writers are told to avoid usage of the passive voice.” A rationalist whose background comes exclusively from science may fail to see the flaw in the previous sentence; but anyone who’s done a little writing should see it right away. I wrote the sentence in the passive voice, without telling you who tells authors to avoid passive voice. Passive voice removes the actor, leaving only the acted-upon. “Unreliable elements were subjected to an alternative justice process”—subjected by whom? What does an “alternative justice process” do? With enough static noun phrases, you can keep anything unpleasant from actually happening.

Journal articles are often written in passive voice. (Pardon me, some scientists write their journal articles in passive voice. It’s not as if the articles are being written by no one, with no one to blame.) It sounds more authoritative to say “The subjects were administered Progenitorivox” than “I gave each college student a bottle of 20 Progenitorivox, and told them to take one every night until they were gone.” If you remove the scientist from the description, that leaves only the all-important data. But in reality the scientist is there, and the subjects are college students, and the Progenitorivox wasn’t “administered” but handed over with instructions. Passive voice obscures reality.

Judging from the comments I get, someone will protest that using the passive voice in a journal article is hardly a sin—after all, if you think about it, you can realize the scientist is there. It doesn’t seem like a logical flaw. And this is why rationalists need to read Orwell, not just Feynman or even Jaynes.

Nonfiction conveys knowledge, fiction conveys experience. Medical science can extrapolate what would happen to a human unprotected in a vacuum. Fiction can make you live through it.

Some rationalists will try to analyze a misleading phrase, try to see if there might possibly be anything meaningful to it, try to construct a logical interpretation. They will be charitable, give the author the benefit of the doubt. Authors, on the other hand, are trained not to give themselves the benefit of the doubt. Whatever the audience thinks you said is what you said, whether you meant to say it or not; you can’t argue with the audience no matter how clever your justifications.

A writer knows that readers will not stop for a minute to think. A fictional experience is a continuous stream of first impressions. A writerrationalist pays attention to the experience words create. If you are evaluating the public rationality of a statement, and you analyze the words deliberatively, rephrasing propositions, trying out different meanings, searching for nuggets of truthiness, then you’re losing track of the first impression—what the audience sees, or rather feels.

A novelist would notice the screaming wrongness of “The subjects were administered Progenitorivox.” What life is here for a reader to live? This sentence creates a distant feeling of authoritativeness, and that’s all—the only experience is the feeling of being told something reliable. A novelist would see nouns too abstract to show what actually happened—the postdoc with the bottle in their hand, trying to look stern; the student listening with a nervous grin.

My point is not to say that journal articles should be written like novels, but that a rationalist should become consciously aware of the experiences which words create. A rationalist must understand the mind and how to operate it. That includes the stream of consciousness, the part of yourself that unfolds in language. A rationalist must become consciously aware of the actual, experiential impact of phrases, beyond their mere propositional semantics.<sup>2</sup>

Or to say it more bluntly: Meaning does not excuse impact!

I don’t care what rational interpretation you can construct for an applause light like “AI should be developed through democratic processes.” That cannot excuse its irrational impact of signaling the audience to applaud, not to mention its cloudy question-begging vagueness.

Here is Orwell, railing against the impact of cliches, their effect on the experience of thinking:

	When one watches some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating the familiar phrases—BESTIAL, ATROCITIES, IRON HEEL, BLOODSTAINED TYRANNY, FREE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD, STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER—one often has a curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind of dummy . . . A speaker who uses that kind of phraseology has gone some distance toward turning himself into a machine. The appropriate noises are coming out of his larynx, but his brain is not involved, as it would be if he were choosing his words for himself . . .

	What is above all needed is to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way around. In prose, the worst thing one can do with words is surrender to them. When you think of a concrete object, you think wordlessly, and then, if you want to describe the thing you have been visualising you probably hunt about until you find the exact words that seem to fit it. When you think of something abstract you are more inclined to use words from the start, and unless you make a conscious effort to prevent it, the existing dialect will come rushing in and do the job for you, at the expense of blurring or even changing your meaning. Probably it is better to put off using words as long as possible and get one’s meaning as clear as one can through pictures and sensations.

Charles Sanders Peirce might have written that last paragraph. More than one path can lead to the Way.
