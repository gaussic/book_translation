## 你的敌人天生邪恶吗？

我们往往过于直接地把他人的行为和他们的内在性格对应起来。我们看到异常的行为，就假设对方有与之完全匹配的异常性格，而不是去思考现实或假想中的情境是否能解释这种行为。我们假设对方是“变异体”。

当有人真的冒犯了我们——做了我们（无论对错）不认可的事时，我发现，这种对应偏误会加倍严重。人们极其倾向于把敌人的恶行归咎于他们天生的、邪恶的性格。这不是道德判断，而是先验概率的问题，我们应该问问：敌人对自己的处境有什么看法，能让他们的行为看起来没那么离奇？这样我们就可以假设他们的性格没那么特殊，从而减少我们所承担的不可能性。

2001年9月11日，十九名穆斯林男性劫持了四架客机，进行自杀式袭击，试图伤害美国。你觉得他们为什么要这么做？难道是因为他们把美国视为世界自由的灯塔，但天生就有一种变异，让他们憎恨自由？

现实中，大多数人不会把自己的人生故事写成反派。每个人都是自己故事的主角。敌人在自己眼中的故事，并不会让自己显得很坏。如果你试图用让敌人看起来很坏的动机去解释他们，你最终只会完全误解敌人的内心世界。

但政治是心灵的杀手。辩论就是战争，论据就是士兵。如果敌人真的天生邪恶，那就是你这边的有力论据。而任何有利于己方的论据都必须支持，无论多荒谬——否则就等于在战场上松懈。每个人都争着比邻居更爱国地谴责敌人，没人敢反驳。很快，敌人就被描绘成长角、长蝙蝠翅膀、喷火、獠牙滴着毒液的怪物。如果你仅仅基于事实否认这些描述，你就是在为敌人说话，你就是叛徒。很少有人能明白，你不是在为敌人辩护，只是在为真相辩护。

如果只有变异体才能做出可怕的事，人类历史会完全不同。变异体本来就很罕见。

或者，也许人们害怕理解会导致宽恕。射杀邪恶变异体更容易。喊“去死吧，恶棍！”比喊“去死吧，那些本可以和我一样，只是成长环境不同的人！”更能激起斗志。杀死不是纯粹黑暗的人，你可能会有负罪感。

在我看来，这反映了人们内心深处渴望一场一边倒的政策辩论，渴望最优政策没有任何缺点。如果有军队越境，或者疯子拿刀冲过来，政策选项就是（a）自卫，或（b）躺下等死。如果你自卫，可能不得不杀人。如果你杀死了一个在另一个世界本可以成为你朋友的人，那是悲剧。确实是悲剧。另一种选择，躺下等死，也是悲剧。为什么一定要有不带悲剧的选项？谁说最优政策就一定没有代价？如果必须有人死，那最好是首先动武的人，这样可以威慑未来的暴力，减少总死亡人数。

如果敌人只是普通人，只是基于对自己处境的某些信念做出了通常的人类反应，这并不意味着他们的信念就是事实，也不意味着他们的行为是正当的。这意味着你不得不开枪打倒一个把自己当作主角的人，而在他们的小说里，主角会在第80页死去。这是悲剧，但比另一种悲剧要好。这是每个警察每天都要做的选择，为了让我们的世界不陷入混乱。

当你准确估计敌人的心理时——当你真正知道敌人心里在想什么——这种知识不会让你觉得自己狠狠打击了对方，也不会让你有正义的愤怒感，更不会让你自我感觉良好。如果你的判断让你感到难以承受的悲伤，也许你才真正看到了世界的本来面目。偶尔，准确的判断也会让你感到深深的恐惧，比如面对真正的精神病患者，或者那些神志健全却被极端信念彻底摧毁理智的人（比如某些邪教信徒）。

所以，让我们直说吧——9/11 劫机者不是邪恶的变异体。他们并不憎恨自由。他们同样是自己故事的主角，他们为自己认为正确的事——真理、正义和伊斯兰之道——而死。如果劫机者这样看待自己，并不意味着他们的信念是真的；也不意味着我们必须同意他们的行为是正当的；也不意味着联合93号航班的乘客就该袖手旁观。但这确实意味着，在另一个世界，如果他们成长环境不同，这些劫机者也许会成为警察。这的确是悲剧。欢迎来到地球。

## Are Your Enemies Innately Evil?

We see far too direct a correspondence between others’ actions and their inherent dispositions. We see unusual dispositions that exactly match the unusual behavior, rather than asking after real situations or imagined situations that could explain the behavior. We hypothesize mutants.

When someone actually offends us—commits an action of which we (rightly or wrongly) disapprove—then, I observe, the correspondence bias redoubles. There seems to be a very strong tendency to blame evil deeds on the Enemy’s mutant, evil disposition. Not as a moral point, but as a strict question of prior probability, we should ask what the Enemy might believe about their situation that would reduce the seeming bizarrity of their behavior. This would allow us to hypothesize a less exceptional disposition, and thereby shoulder a lesser burden of improbability.

On September 11th, 2001, nineteen Muslim males hijacked four jet airliners in a deliberately suicidal effort to hurt the United States of America. Now why do you suppose they might have done that? Because they saw the USA as a beacon of freedom to the world, but were born with a mutant disposition that made them hate freedom?

Realistically, most people don’t construct their life stories with themselves as the villains. Everyone is the hero of their own story. The Enemy’s story, as seen by the Enemy, is not going to make the Enemy look bad. If you try to construe motivations that would make the Enemy look bad, you’ll end up flat wrong about what actually goes on in the Enemy’s mind.

But politics is the mind-killer. Debate is war; arguments are soldiers. If the Enemy did have an evil disposition, that would be an argument in favor of your side. And any argument that favors your side must be supported, no matter how silly—otherwise you’re letting up the pressure somewhere on the battlefront. Everyone strives to outshine their neighbor in patriotic denunciation, and no one dares to contradict. Soon the Enemy has horns, bat wings, flaming breath, and fangs that drip corrosive venom. If you deny any aspect of this on merely factual grounds, you are arguing the Enemy’s side; you are a traitor. Very few people will understand that you aren’t defending the Enemy, just defending the truth.

If it took a mutant to do monstrous things, the history of the human species would look very different. Mutants would be rare.

Or maybe the fear is that understanding will lead to forgiveness. It’s easier to shoot down evil mutants. It is a more inspiring battle cry to scream, “Die, vicious scum!” instead of “Die, people who could have been just like me but grew up in a different environment!” You might feel guilty killing people who weren’t pure darkness.

This looks to me like the deep-seated yearning for a one-sided policy debate in which the best policy has no drawbacks. If an army is crossing the border or a lunatic is coming at you with a knife, the policy alternatives are (a) defend yourself or (b) lie down and die. If you defend yourself, you may have to kill. If you kill someone who could, in another world, have been your friend, that is a tragedy. And it is a tragedy. The other option, lying down and dying, is also a tragedy. Why must there be a non-tragic option? Who says that the best policy available must have no downside? If someone has to die, it may as well be the initiator of force, to discourage future violence and thereby minimize the total sum of death.

If the Enemy has an average disposition, and is acting from beliefs about their situation that would make violence a typically human response, then that doesn’t mean their beliefs are factually accurate. It doesn’t mean they’re justified. It means you’ll have to shoot down someone who is the hero of their own story, and in their novel the protagonist will die on page 80. That is a tragedy, but it is better than the alternative tragedy. It is the choice that every police officer makes, every day, to keep our neat little worlds from dissolving into chaos.

When you accurately estimate the Enemy’s psychology—when you know what is really in the Enemy’s mind—that knowledge won’t feel like landing a delicious punch on the opposing side. It won’t give you a warm feeling of righteous indignation. It won’t make you feel good about yourself. If your estimate makes you feel unbearably sad, you may be seeing the world as it really is. More rarely, an accurate estimate may send shivers of serious horror down your spine, as when dealing with true psychopaths, or neurologically intact people with beliefs that have utterly destroyed their sanity (Scientologists or Jesus Campers).

So let’s come right out and say it—the 9/11 hijackers weren’t evil mutants. They did not hate freedom. They, too, were the heroes of their own stories, and they died for what they believed was right—truth, justice, and the Islamic way. If the hijackers saw themselves that way, it doesn’t mean their beliefs were true. If the hijackers saw themselves that way, it doesn’t mean that we have to agree that what they did was justified. If the hijackers saw themselves that way, it doesn’t mean that the passengers of United Flight 93 should have stood aside and let it happen. It does mean that in another world, if they had been raised in a different environment, those hijackers might have been police officers. And that is indeed a tragedy. Welcome to Earth.
