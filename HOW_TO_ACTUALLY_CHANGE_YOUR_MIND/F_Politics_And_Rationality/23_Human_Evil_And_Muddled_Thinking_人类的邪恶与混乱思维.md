## 人类的邪恶与混乱思维

乔治·奥威尔亲眼目睹了文明世界滑向极权主义，一个又一个国家被同化或腐化；靴子永远地踩在人脸上——请记住，是永远。你生得太晚，无法记得那个极权主义崛起势不可挡的年代，一个又一个国家沦陷于秘密警察和午夜雷鸣般的敲门声，而自由大学的教授们还把苏联的大清洗当作进步来歌颂。对你来说，这一切就像小说一样陌生，你很难认真对待。因为在你的时间线上，柏林墙倒塌了。如果奥威尔的名字没有刻在那堵墙的石头上，那就应该刻上。

奥威尔看到了人类的命运，并付出了极大的努力试图让它脱离原有的轨道。奥威尔的武器是清晰的写作。奥威尔明白，混乱的语言就是混乱的思维；他知道人类的邪恶与混乱思维如同DNA的两股螺旋紧密缠绕：<sup>1</sup>

    在我们这个时代，政治言论和写作大多是在为不可辩护之事辩护。比如英国继续统治印度、苏联的大清洗和流放、对日本投下原子弹，这些事情确实可以被辩护，但只有用大多数人无法直面的残酷论据，且这些论据与政党的公开目标并不一致。因此，政治语言不得不主要由委婉语、偷换概念和彻底的模糊构成。无防御能力的村庄被空袭，居民被赶到乡下，牛群被机枪扫射，茅屋被燃烧弹点燃：这被称为“平定”……

奥威尔对自己追求清晰的目标非常明确：

    如果你简化你的英语，你就能摆脱最愚蠢的正统观念。你无法说出任何必要的方言，而当你说出愚蠢的话时，连你自己都能看出它的愚蠢。

让我们的愚蠢连自己都能看见——这正是“克服偏见”的核心。

邪恶总是隐藏在心灵未被照亮的阴影中。我们回望历史的清晰，看到斯大林和毛泽东有计划的大饥荒，数千万人因此丧命，我们会为之痛哭。我们称之为邪恶，因为这是人类有意给无辜者带来痛苦和死亡。我们称之为邪恶，是因为在历史的清晰中，我们对其感到强烈的厌恶。为了让作恶者逃避自然的反对，这种厌恶必须被压制。无论付出多大代价，都要避免清晰。正如有清晰视野的人会反对他们所见的邪恶一样，邪恶本身也总是试图让思维变得混乱。

《一九八四》对此有极为鲜明的刻画：奥威尔笔下的终极反派，是那些剪裁和涂改照片的人（原型正是苏联历史上的剪裁和涂改）。在“爱之部”的至暗时刻，奥布莱恩拷打温斯顿，逼他承认二加二等于五：<sup>2</sup>

    “你还记得吗，”他继续说，“你在日记里写过，‘自由就是可以说二加二等于四’？”

    “记得。”温斯顿说。

    奥布莱恩举起左手，手背朝向温斯顿，拇指藏起，伸出四根手指。

    “温斯顿，我现在举着几根手指？”

    “四根。”

    “如果党说不是四根而是五根——那是多少？”

    “四根。”

    话音未落，温斯顿就痛苦地喘息起来。仪表盘的指针猛然跳到五十五。汗水从温斯顿全身冒出。空气撕裂着进入他的肺部，又发出深沉的呻吟，即使咬紧牙关也无法抑制。奥布莱恩看着他，四根手指依然伸着。他松开了杠杆，这次疼痛稍微减轻了一点。

我总是对一些看似聪明的人——比如罗宾·汉森的同事泰勒·考恩——竟然觉得克服偏见并不重要而感到震惊。<sup>3</sup> 这可是你的大脑啊。你的人类智慧。它让你区别于猩猩。它创造了这个世界。你不觉得大脑的工作方式重要吗？你不觉得大脑的系统性故障重要吗？你觉得如果人人都是理想的贝叶斯主义者，宗教裁判所还会去拷打女巫吗？

泰勒·考恩显然认为，克服偏见和偏见本身一样有偏见：“我觉得罗宾的博客正好体现了偏见，甚至说明偏见很有用。”我希望这只是他为了显得聪明而过度抽象思考的结果。难道泰勒真的认为，对人命价值的范围不敏感和努力制定真正能拯救更多生命的计划，是一回事吗？

奥威尔也不得不与类似的态度作斗争——承认任何区别都是幼稚的天真：

    斯图尔特·蔡斯等人几乎声称所有抽象词都是无意义的，并以此为借口，主张一种政治上的静观主义。既然你都不知道什么是法西斯主义，你又怎么能反对法西斯主义呢？

也许，如果把克服偏见描述成与偶然错误的斗争，它看起来就不够激动人心。也许如果没有明确的邪恶可反对，人们就很难激动起来。那么让我们绝对清楚地说：只要世界上有人类的邪恶，只要有残忍、酷刑和蓄意谋杀，就一定有偏见在为其遮掩。只要有目光清晰的人反对这些偏见，隐藏的邪恶就会反击。真理确实有敌人。如果“克服偏见”是苏联时期的一份通讯，每一位发帖人和评论者都早已被送进劳改营。

纵观人类历史，每一次伟大的进步都源于思想的澄明。除了极少数自然灾害，每一次巨大的苦难都源于愚蠢。我们最后的敌人是我们自己；这是一场战争，而我们是士兵。

## Human Evil and Muddled Thinking

George Orwell saw the descent of the civilized world into totalitarianism, the conversion or corruption of one country after another; the boot stamping on a human face, forever, and remember that it is forever. You were born too late to remember a time when the rise of totalitarianism seemed unstoppable, when one country after another fell to secret police and the thunderous knock at midnight, while the professors of free universities hailed the Soviet Union’s purges as progress. It feels as alien to you as fiction; it is hard for you to take seriously. Because, in your branch of time, the Berlin Wall fell. And if Orwell’s name is not carved into one of those stones, it should be.

Orwell saw the destiny of the human species, and he put forth a convulsive effort to wrench it off its path. Orwell’s weapon was clear writing. Orwell knew that muddled language is muddled thinking; he knew that human evil and muddled thinking intertwine like conjugate strands of DNA:<sup>1</sup>

	In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of the political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenceless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called PACIFICATION . . .

Orwell was clear on the goal of his clarity:

	If you simplify your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy. You cannot speak any of the necessary dialects, and when you make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself.

To make our stupidity obvious, even to ourselves—this is the heart of Overcoming Bias.

Evil sneaks, hidden, through the unlit shadows of the mind. We look back with the clarity of history, and weep to remember the planned famines of Stalin and Mao, which killed tens of millions. We call this evil, because it was done by deliberate human intent to inflict pain and death upon innocent human beings. We call this evil, because of the revulsion that we feel against it, looking back with the clarity of history. For perpetrators of evil to avoid its natural opposition, the revulsion must remain latent. Clarity must be avoided at any cost. Even as humans of clear sight tend to oppose the evil that they see; so too does human evil, wherever it exists, set out to muddle thinking.

1984 sets this forth starkly: Orwell’s ultimate villains are cutters and airbrushers of photographs (based on historical cutting and airbrushing in the Soviet Union). At the peak of all darkness in the Ministry of Love, O’Brien tortures Winston to admit that two plus two equals five:<sup>2</sup>

	“Do you remember,” he went on, “writing in your diary, ‘Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four’?”

	“Yes,” said Winston.

	O’Brien held up his left hand, its back towards Winston, with the thumb hidden and the four fingers extended.

	“How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?”

	“Four.”

	“And if the party says that it is not four but five—then how many?”

	“Four.”

	The word ended in a gasp of pain. The needle of the dial had shot up to fifty-five. The sweat had sprung out all over Winston’s body. The air tore into his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching his teeth he could not stop. O’Brien watched him, the four fingers still extended. He drew back the lever. This time the pain was only slightly eased.

I am continually aghast at apparently intelligent folks—such as Robin Hanson’s colleague Tyler Cowen—who don’t think that overcoming bias is important.<sup>3</sup> This is your mind we’re talking about. Your human intelligence. It separates you from an orangutan. It built this world. You don’t think how the mind works is important? You don’t think the mind’s systematic malfunctions are important? Do you think the Inquisition would have tortured witches, if all were ideal Bayesians?

Tyler Cowen apparently feels that overcoming bias is just as biased as bias: “I view Robin’s blog as exemplifying bias, and indeed showing that bias can be very useful.” I hope this is only the result of thinking too abstractly while trying to sound clever. Does Tyler seriously think that scope insensitivity to the value of human life is on the same level with trying to create plans that will really save as many lives as possible?

Orwell was forced to fight a similar attitude—that to admit to any distinction is youthful naiveté:

	Stuart Chase and others have come near to claiming that all abstract words are meaningless, and have used this as a pretext for advocating a kind of political quietism. Since you don’t know what Fascism is, how can you struggle against Fascism?

Maybe overcoming bias doesn’t look quite exciting enough, if it’s framed as a struggle against mere accidental mistakes. Maybe it’s harder to get excited if there isn’t some clear evil to oppose. So let us be absolutely clear that where there is human evil in the world, where there is cruelty and torture and deliberate murder, there are biases enshrouding it. Where people of clear sight oppose these biases, the concealed evil fights back. The truth does have enemies. If Overcoming Bias were a newsletter in the old Soviet Union, every poster and commenter of Overcoming Bias would have been shipped off to labor camps.

In all human history, every great leap forward has been driven by a new clarity of thought. Except for a few natural catastrophes, every great woe has been driven by a stupidity. Our last enemy is ourselves; and this is a war, and we are soldiers.
