## 政策辩论不应呈现一边倒

罗宾·汉森提出过一种建议：设立可以出售被禁产品的商店。<sup>1</sup> 这种政策有很多优秀的理由支持——比如个人自由的固有权利、官僚出于职业激励倾向于禁止一切、立法者和普通人一样有偏见。但即便如此（我回应道），总会有某个贫穷、诚实、受教育程度不高、养着五个孩子的母亲走进这些商店，买下“蛇油博士硫酸饮料”来治关节炎，结果丧命，留下孤儿在全国电视上哭泣。

我只是陈述了一个事实。为什么有些人觉得这是支持监管的论据？

在简单事实问题上（比如地球生命是否由自然选择产生），我们有理由期待论证呈现一边倒的局面；事实本身只有一种可能，“证据的平衡”也应当反映这一点。实际上，按贝叶斯证据定义，“强有力的证据”就是我们只会在某一方论证中预期出现的那种证据。

但对于有许多后果的复杂行动来说，没有理由要求这种一边倒的特性。为什么人们似乎希望政策辩论也呈现一边倒？

政治是心灵的杀手。论据就是士兵。一旦你知道自己站在哪一边，就必须支持本方所有论据，攻击所有有利于敌方的论据；否则就像在背后捅自己士兵一刀，等于资敌。如果你陷入这种模式，政策辩论在你看来也会是一边倒的——你支持的政策的所有成本和缺点都是“敌方士兵”，必须不择手段攻击。

你还要警惕另一种相关的失败模式：认为“深刻智慧”的做法是，在最受关注的两种政策立场之间平均妥协。实际上，某些政策的成本或收益确实可能极度不均衡。如果所有政策问题都没有倾向性，我们就无法做出决策。但人类也有一种倾向，会否认自己支持政策的所有成本，或否认自己反对政策的所有收益；因此人们往往觉得政策权衡比实际情况更极端。

如果你允许出售被禁产品的商店存在，总会有某个贫穷、诚实、受教育程度不高、养着五个孩子的母亲买到致命的东西。这是对事实后果的预测，作为事实问题其实很直接——无论你支持哪种政策立场，理智的人都应该坦然承认这是真的。你也可以认为，禁令只会让东西更贵，监管者会滥用权力，或者她的个人自由高于你干涉她生活的愿望。但作为简单事实，她还是会死。

我们生活在一个不公平的宇宙里。像所有灵长类动物一样，人类对感知到的不公有强烈的负面反应，因此我们会为此感到压力。应对这种认知失调有两种常见方法。第一，可以改变对事实的看法——否认不公事件发生，或篡改历史让它看起来公平。<sup>2</sup> 第二，可以改变自己的道德观——否认这些事件是不公的。

有些自由意志主义者可能会说，如果你走进“被禁产品商店”，明明看到警告标签写着“本店商品可能致命”，还买了致命的东西，那就是你自己的错，你活该。如果这是道德真理，那么允许出售被禁产品的商店就没有任何负面后果。这不仅是净收益，甚至是一边倒的权衡，没有任何缺点。

另一些人则认为，监管者可以被训练得理性且能与消费者利益保持一致；如果事实真是如此（在他们的道德观下），那么监管也没有任何负面后果。

不管你愿不愿意，智力的“出生彩票”确实存在——虽然这种不公平极端到许多人选择否认。关于遗传成分为 0.6–0.8 的实验证据极其充分，但即使否认基因，你也无法选择自己的家庭环境或早期学校。

我从小被教育，否认现实是一种道德错误。如果我对“硫酸饮料”会带来好处抱有一厢情愿的乐观，那就是在做我被告诫过、被教育为不可接受的事。有些人出生在这样的环境——我们暂且不谈基因，因为那太不公平了——他们身边的巫医告诉他们，信仰是对的，怀疑是错的。他们善意地遵循建议，结果丧命。和你不同，他们并没有被教育要为自己选择跟随社会的决定负责。你真的觉得自己有多聪明，哪怕生在公元 500 年，也会成为合格的科学怀疑论者吗？无论你如何看待基因，出生彩票都存在。

说“买危险产品的人活该受伤！”并不是真正的强硬态度。这其实是一种拒绝接受不公平宇宙的方式。真正的强硬态度是说：“是的，硫酸会让人死得极其痛苦，不，这位五个孩子的母亲并不该死，但我们还是要让商店开下去，因为我们做了成本收益计算。”你能想象有哪个政客会这样说吗？我也不能。但只要经济学家有影响政策的能力，哪怕他们只是私下这样想——甚至在学术论文里用多音节的晦涩术语写出来，让媒体无法引用——也许都会有帮助。

我并不认为有人做了愚蠢的选择而死，是值得庆祝的事。我认为那是悲剧。并不是每次都要救人脱离自己行为的后果才算帮助；但我在死刑问题上有道德底线。如果你死了，就再也无法从错误中学习。

不幸的是，宇宙并不认同我的看法。等一切结束时，我们看看谁还能站着。

## Policy Debates Should Not Appear One-Sided

Robin Hanson proposed stores where banned products could be sold.<sup>1</sup> There are a number of excellent arguments for such a policy—an inherent right of individual liberty, the career incentive of bureaucrats to prohibit everything, legislators being just as biased as individuals. But even so (I replied), some poor, honest, not overwhelmingly educated mother of five children is going to go into these stores and buy a “Dr. Snakeoil’s Sulfuric Acid Drink” for her arthritis and die, leaving her orphans to weep on national television.

I was just making a factual observation. Why did some people think it was an argument in favor of regulation?

On questions of simple fact (for example, whether Earthly life arose by natural selection) there’s a legitimate expectation that the argument should be a one-sided battle; the facts themselves are either one way or another, and the so-called “balance of evidence” should reflect this. Indeed, under the Bayesian definition of evidence, “strong evidence” is just that sort of evidence which we only expect to find on one side of an argument.

But there is no reason for complex actions with many consequences to exhibit this onesidedness property. Why do people seem to want their policy debates to be one-sided?

Politics is the mind-killer. Arguments are soldiers. Once you know which side you’re on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it’s like stabbing your soldiers in the back. If you abide within that pattern, policy debates will also appear one-sided to you—the costs and drawbacks of your favored policy are enemy soldiers, to be attacked by any means necessary.

One should also be aware of a related failure pattern: thinking that the course of Deep Wisdom is to compromise with perfect evenness between whichever two policy positions receive the most airtime. A policy may legitimately have lopsided costs or benefits. If policy questions were not tilted one way or the other, we would be unable to make decisions about them. But there is also a human tendency to deny all costs of a favored policy, or deny all benefits of a disfavored policy; and people will therefore tend to think policy tradeoffs are tilted much further than they actually are.

If you allow shops that sell otherwise banned products, some poor, honest, poorly educated mother of five kids is going to buy something that kills her. This is a prediction about a factual consequence, and as a factual question it appears rather straightforward—a sane person should readily confess this to be true regardless of which stance they take on the policy issue. You may also think that making things illegal just makes them more expensive, that regulators will abuse their power, or that her individual freedom trumps your desire to meddle with her life. But, as a matter of simple fact, she’s still going to die.

We live in an unfair universe. Like all primates, humans have strong negative reactions to perceived unfairness; thus we find this fact stressful. There are two popular methods of dealing with the resulting cognitive dissonance. First, one may change one’s view of the facts—deny that the unfair events took place, or edit the history to make it appear fair.<sup>2</sup> Second, one may change one’s morality—deny that the events are unfair.

Some libertarians might say that if you go into a “banned products shop,” passing clear warning labels that say THINGS IN THIS STORE MAY KILL YOU, and buy something that kills you, then it’s your own fault and you deserve it. If that were a moral truth, there would be no downside to having shops that sell banned products. It wouldn’t just be a net benefit, it would be a one-sided tradeoff with no drawbacks.

Others argue that regulators can be trained to choose rationally and in harmony with consumer interests; if those were the facts of the matter then (in their moral view) there would be no downside to regulation.

Like it or not, there’s a birth lottery for intelligence—though this is one of the cases where the universe’s unfairness is so extreme that many people choose to deny the facts. The experimental evidence for a purely genetic component of 0.6–0.8 is overwhelming, but even if this were to be denied, you don’t choose your parental upbringing or your early schools either.

I was raised to believe that denying reality is a moral wrong. If I were to engage in wishful optimism about how Sulfuric Acid Drink was likely to benefit me, I would be doing something that I was warned against and raised to regard as unacceptable. Some people are born into environments—we won’t discuss their genes, because that part is too unfair—where the local witch doctor tells them that it is right to have faith and wrong to be skeptical. In all goodwill, they follow this advice and die. Unlike you, they weren’t raised to believe that people are responsible for their individual choices to follow society’s lead. Do you really think you’re so smart that you would have been a proper scientific skeptic even if you’d been born in 500 CE? Yes, there is a birth lottery, no matter what you believe about genes.

Saying “People who buy dangerous products deserve to get hurt!” is not tough-minded. It is a way of refusing to live in an unfair universe. Real tough-mindedness is saying, “Yes, sulfuric acid is a horrible painful death, and no, that mother of five children didn’t deserve it, but we’re going to keep the shops open anyway because we did this cost-benefit calculation.” Can you imagine a politician saying that? Neither can I. But insofar as economists have the power to influence policy, it might help if they could think it privately—maybe even say it in journal articles, suitably dressed up in polysyllabismic obfuscationalization so the media can’t quote it.

I don’t think that when someone makes a stupid choice and dies, this is a cause for celebration. I count it as a tragedy. It is not always helping people, to save them from the consequences of their own actions; but I draw a moral line at capital punishment. If you’re dead, you can’t learn from your mistakes.

Unfortunately the universe doesn’t agree with me. We’ll see which one of us is still standing when this is over.
