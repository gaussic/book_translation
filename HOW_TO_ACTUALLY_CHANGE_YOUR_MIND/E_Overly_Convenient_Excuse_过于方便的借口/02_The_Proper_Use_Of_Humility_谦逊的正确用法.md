## 谦逊的正确用法

众所周知，好的科学需要某种谦逊。但到底是哪种谦逊，则存在争议。

想想那个创世论者会说：“但谁又能真正知道进化论是不是对的呢？这只是个理论。你应该更谦逊、更开放。”这算谦逊吗？创世论者表现出一种非常选择性的自我怀疑，拒绝接受大量支持他们不喜欢结论的证据。我认为，不管你是否称之为“谦逊”，这都不是正确的做法。

再比如那个工程师，虽然非常确信机器不会出故障，但还是谦逊地为机器设计了故障保护机制？在我看来，这就是好的谦逊。历史上，工程师对新机器信心满满，结果机器还是出故障的情况并不少见。

还有那个学生，谦逊地把数学考试的答案又检查了一遍？我也会把这归为好的谦逊。这个学生想要变得更强，他意识到自己可能有缺陷，于是尽力去修正。

但如果有个学生说：“不管我检查多少遍，我都不能确定答案是对的。”于是一次都不检查？即使这种选择源于和前一个学生类似的情感，也不够明智。

你建议他多学点，他却回答：“不，这对我没用；我又不是你们这些聪明孩子；像我这么卑微的人，命运也不会更好。”这其实是社会意义上的谦虚，而不是谦逊。它关乎部落中的地位调节，而不是科学过程。如果你让别人“更谦逊”，他们通常会联想到社会谦虚——这是直观、日常、祖先环境中相关的概念。科学谦逊则是更近代、更稀有的发明，本质上并不社会化。即使你独自一人在太空服里，远离地球，没有人看着你，科学谦逊依然适用。哪怕你被保证无论说什么、想什么都不会再被批评，你如果足够明智，还是会检查自己的计算。

学生说：“可我见过有学生检查了答案还是错了。或者，归纳法的问题下，这次2+2=5怎么办？不管我怎么做，都不能确定。”听起来很深刻，也很谦虚。但巧合的是，这个学生总想快点交卷回家打游戏。

物理学的时代终结并不总是雷霆万钧地到来；更多时候只是一个微小的瑕疵……但正因为物理学家有种傲慢的想法，认为他们的模型应该一直有效，而不是大多数时候有效，所以他们会追查这些小瑕疵。通常，瑕疵在仔细检查下会消失。极少数情况下，瑕疵会扩大到推翻整个理论。因此有言：“如果你不追求完美，你连第一步都迈不出去。”

但想想看，试图永远正确在社会上是多么大胆的行为！我真怀疑，如果科学只声称进化论大多数时候成立，但不是一直成立——或者科学承认有些日子地球是平的，但谁又能确定——那么科学家的社会声誉会更好。科学会显得不那么咄咄逼人，因为我们不用和“地球是平的”论者争论——可以有妥协空间。你争论多了，人们就觉得你咄咄逼人。如果你反复拒绝妥协，情况更糟。以部落地位来看：科学家确实因为带来了药物、手机等社会有用工具而赢得了额外地位。但这种地位并不能证明他们坚持只在公立学校教授科学进化论是合理的。毕竟，牧师也有很高的社会地位。科学家太自以为是了——赢了一点地位，就觉得自己是整个部落的首领！他们应该更谦逊，稍微妥协一点。

许多人对“理性主义者的谦逊”有着模糊的看法。拥有一个你自己都模糊理解的规范性原则是危险的；你脑中的模型有太多自由度，可以用来为几乎任何行为辩护。只要人们有可以为任何事辩护的模糊模型，最终他们总会相信自己一开始就想相信的东西。这太方便了，以至于人们常常不愿放弃模糊。但伦理的目的是推动我们前进，而不是被我们操控。

“谦逊”是一个常被误解的美德。这并不意味着我们应该抛弃谦逊这个概念，但我们在使用时要小心。你可以看看“谦逊”思路下推荐的行为，问问自己：“这样做会让我变得更强，还是更弱？”如果你把归纳法的问题应用到一座需要屹立不倒的桥上，得出“无论采取什么预防措施都无法确定”的结论似乎很合理；但如果你考虑在现实中多加几根缆索和直接无视的区别，哪个桥更坚固就很明显了。

我见过的绝大多数“理性主义谦逊”呼吁，其实都是用来推卸责任的借口。比如买彩票的人说：“你不能确定我会输。”不信进化论的人说：“你不能向我证明它是真的。”拒绝面对难题的人说：“这题大概太难了。”问题在于动机性怀疑，也叫反证偏误——对自己不想相信的主张格外挑剔。谦逊在最常被误解的形式下，是一种通用的借口——反正你永远不能确定。警惕这种通用借口！

另一个问题是，谦逊太容易被口头宣称。丹尼特在《打破魔咒：宗教作为一种自然现象》中指出，许多宗教主张很难相信，但人们很容易相信自己“应该”相信它们。丹尼特称之为“信仰信仰”。真正假设、真正相信“三等于一”意味着什么？其实更容易相信“你应该相信三等于一”，并在教堂合适的时候做出这种回应。丹尼特建议，许多“宗教信仰”其实应该被当作“宗教宣称”来研究——即人们认为自己应该相信什么，以及他们知道自己该说什么。

用“我当然可能错了”来回应每一个反驳实在太容易了。只要向“谦逊”方向鞠个躬，完成必要的仪式，你就可以继续原来的路，什么都不用改变。

人总是想用最小的努力获得最多的分数。我们总是倾向于以一种让我们尽可能少改变信念和行动的方式，谨慎地整合所有新信息。约翰·肯尼斯·加尔布雷斯说过：“在改变想法和证明无需改变之间，几乎所有人都会忙于证明。”而且，改变想法越麻烦，人们就越会为证明自己不用改变而努力。

但你知道吗，如果你反正还是要做同样的事，何必费那么大劲去合理化？我常常看到人们遇到新信息，表面上接受了，然后又仔细解释为什么他们还是会做原来打算做的事，只不过理由变了而已。思考的意义在于塑造我们的计划；如果你反正不打算改变计划，何必费劲去辩解？遇到新信息，难的是更新、反应，而不是让信息消失在黑洞里。被误解的谦逊就是个绝妙的黑洞——你只需承认自己可能错了。因此有言：“谦逊，就是在预见到自己会犯错时采取具体行动。承认自己会犯错却什么都不做，不是谦逊，而是炫耀自己的谦虚。”

## The Proper Use of Humility

It is widely recognized that good science requires some kind of humility. What sort of humility is more controversial.

Consider the creationist who says: “But who can really know whether evolution is correct? It is just a theory. You should be more humble and open-minded.” Is this humility? The creationist practices a very selective underconfidence, refusing to integrate massive weights of evidence in favor of a conclusion they find uncomfortable. I would say that whether you call this “humility” or not, it is the wrong step in the dance.

What about the engineer who humbly designs fail-safe mechanisms into machinery, even though they’re damn sure the machinery won’t fail? This seems like a good kind of humility to me. Historically, it’s not unheard-of for an engineer to be damn sure a new machine won’t fail, and then it fails anyway.

What about the student who humbly double-checks the answers on their math test? Again I’d categorize that as good humility. The student who double-checks their answers wants to become stronger; they react to a possible inner flaw by doing what they can to repair the flaw.

What about a student who says, “Well, no matter how many times I check, I can’t ever be certain my test answers are correct,” and therefore doesn’t check even once? Even if this choice stems from an emotion similar to the emotion felt by the previous student, it is less wise.

You suggest studying harder, and the student replies: “No, it wouldn’t work for me; I’m not one of the smart kids like you; nay, one so lowly as myself can hope for no better lot.” This is social modesty, not humility. It has to do with regulating status in the tribe, rather than scientific process. If you ask someone to “be more humble,” by default they’ll associate the words to social modesty—which is an intuitive, everyday, ancestrally relevant concept. Scientific humility is a more recent and rarefied invention, and it is not inherently social. Scientific humility is something you would practice even if you were alone in a spacesuit, light years from Earth with no one watching. Or even if you received an absolute guarantee that no one would ever criticize you again, no matter what you said or thought of yourself. You’d still double-check your calculations if you were wise.

The student says: “But I’ve seen other students double-check their answers and then they still turned out to be wrong. Or what if, by the problem of induction, 2 + 2 = 5 this time around? No matter what I do, I won’t be sure of myself.” It sounds very profound, and very modest. But it is not coincidence that the student wants to hand in the test quickly, and go home and play video games.

The end of an era in physics does not always announce itself with thunder and trumpets; more often it begins with what seems like a small, small flaw . . . But because physicists have this arrogant idea that their models should work all the time, not just most of the time, they follow up on small flaws. Usually, the small flaw goes away under closer inspection. Rarely, the flaw widens to the point where it blows up the whole theory. Therefore it is written: “If you do not seek perfection you will halt before taking your first steps.”

But think of the social audacity of trying to be right all the time! I seriously suspect that if Science claimed that evolutionary theory is true most of the time but not all of the time—or if Science conceded that maybe on some days the Earth is flat, but who really knows—then scientists would have better social reputations. Science would be viewed as less confrontational, because we wouldn’t have to argue with people who say the Earth is flat—there would be room for compromise. When you argue a lot, people look upon you as confrontational. If you repeatedly refuse to compromise, it’s even worse. Consider it as a question of tribal status: scientists have certainly earned some extra status in exchange for such socially useful tools as medicine and cellphones. But this social status does not justify their insistence that only scientific ideas on evolution be taught in public schools. Priests also have high social status, after all. Scientists are getting above themselves—they won a little status, and now they think they’re chiefs of the whole tribe! They ought to be more humble, and compromise a little.

Many people seem to possess rather hazy views of “rationalist humility.” It is dangerous to have a prescriptive principle which you only vaguely comprehend; your mental picture may have so many degrees of freedom that it can adapt to justify almost any deed. Where people have vague mental models that can be used to argue anything, they usually end up believing whatever they started out wanting to believe. This is so convenient that people are often reluctant to give up vagueness. But the purpose of our ethics is to move us, not be moved by us.

“Humility” is a virtue that is often misunderstood. This doesn’t mean we should discard the concept of humility, but we should be careful using it. It may help to look at the actions recommended by a “humble” line of thinking, and ask: “Does acting this way make you stronger, or weaker?” If you think about the problem of induction as applied to a bridge that needs to stay up, it may sound reasonable to conclude that nothing is certain no matter what precautions are employed; but if you consider the real-world difference between adding a few extra cables, and shrugging, it seems clear enough what makes the stronger bridge.

The vast majority of appeals that I witness to “rationalist’s humility” are excuses to shrug. The one who buys a lottery ticket, saying, “But you can’t know that I’ll lose.” The one who disbelieves in evolution, saying, “But you can’t prove to me that it’s true.” The one who refuses to confront a difficultlooking problem, saying, “It’s probably too hard to solve.” The problem is motivated skepticism a.k.a. disconfirmation bias—more heavily scrutinizing assertions that we don’t want to believe.<sup>1</sup> Humility, in its most commonly misunderstood form, is a fully general excuse not to believe something; since, after all, you can’t be sure. Beware of fully general excuses!

A further problem is that humility is all too easy to profess. Dennett, in Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon, points out that while many religious assertions are very hard to believe, it is easy for people to believe that they ought to believe them. Dennett terms this “belief in belief.” What would it mean to really assume, to really believe, that three is equal to one? It’s a lot easier to believe that you should, somehow, believe that three equals one, and to make this response at the appropriate points in church. Dennett suggests that much “religious belief” should be studied as “religious profession”—what people think they should believe and what they know they ought to say.

It is all too easy to meet every counterargument by saying, “Well, of course I could be wrong.” Then, having dutifully genuflected in the direction of Modesty, having made the required obeisance, you can go on about your way without changing a thing.

The temptation is always to claim the most points with the least effort. The temptation is to carefully integrate all incoming news in a way that lets us change our beliefs, and above all our actions, as little as possible. John Kenneth Galbraith said: “Faced with the choice of changing one’s mind and proving that there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof.”<sup>2</sup> And the greater the inconvenience of changing one’s mind, the more effort people will expend on the proof.

But y’know, if you’re gonna do the same thing anyway, there’s no point in going to such incredible lengths to rationalize it. Often I have witnessed people encountering new information, apparently accepting it, and then carefully explaining why they are going to do exactly the same thing they planned to do previously, but with a different justification. The point of thinking is to shape our plans; if you’re going to keep the same plans anyway, why bother going to all that work to justify it? When you encounter new information, the hard part is to update, to react, rather than just letting the information disappear down a black hole. And humility, properly misunderstood, makes a wonderful black hole—all you have to do is admit you could be wrong. Therefore it is written: “To be humble is to take specific actions in anticipation of your own errors. To confess your fallibility and then do nothing about it is not humble; it is boasting of your modesty.”
