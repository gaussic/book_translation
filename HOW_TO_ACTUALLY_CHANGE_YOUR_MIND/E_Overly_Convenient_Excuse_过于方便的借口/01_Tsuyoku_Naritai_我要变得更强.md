## Tsuyoku Naritai！（我要变得更强）

在正统犹太教中有一句谚语：“上一代之于下一代，如同天使之于人；下一代之于上一代，如同驴之于人。”这源于正统犹太教的信仰：所有犹太律法都是上帝在西奈山赐予摩西的。毕竟，你不可能通过实验获得新的律法知识；你只能通过别人告诉你（而那个人又是从别人那里听来的，最终追溯到上帝）。既然没有新的信息来源，知识只能在一代代传递中逐渐丢失，而不会增加。

因此，现代拉比不能推翻古代拉比的裁决。爬行动物通常是不洁的，但吃苹果里发现的虫子却是允许的——因为古代拉比认为虫子是在苹果内部自发生成的，因此算作苹果的一部分。现代拉比不能说：“好吧，古代拉比其实对生物学一无所知，推翻！”现代拉比不可能知道古代拉比不知道的律法原则，因为古代拉比又怎么能把答案从西奈山传给他呢？知识源自权威，因此只会随着时间流逝而丧失，而不会增加。

我第一次在（宗教）小学听到“天使与驴”的谚语时，还没到完全无神论的年纪，但我心里还是想：“托拉每一代都在丢失知识。科学每一代都在获得知识。不管起点如何，迟早科学会超越托拉。”

最重要的是，必须有进步。只要你不断前进，总会到达目的地；但如果你停下脚步，就永远无法到达。

“Tsuyoku naritai”是日语。Tsuyoku 意为“强大”；naru 是“变得”；naritai 是“想要变得”。合起来就是“我想变得更强”，这种情感在日本作品中体现得比我读过的任何西方文学都更为强烈。你可能在表达想成为职业围棋手时说这句话——或者在输掉重要比赛但还没放弃时说——或者在赢了重要比赛但还不是九段时说——甚至在你已成为史上最伟大的围棋手，但仍觉得自己还能更进一步时说。这就是 tsuyoku naritai，超越自我的意志。

每年赎罪日，正统犹太人都会背诵一段祷文，从 Ashamnu, bagadnu, gazalnu, dibarnu dofi 开始，按希伯来字母顺序列举所有罪行：我们行事可耻，我们背叛，我们偷窃，我们诽谤……

每念一个词，就要捶一下自己的心以示忏悔。并没有规定说，如果你一年都没偷东西，就可以跳过 gazalnu 少捶一次心。那样会违背赎罪日的集体精神——赎罪日是用来忏悔罪行的，而不是为了少忏悔一点就努力避免犯罪。

同样，Ashamnu 并不会以“但那是今年，明年我会做得更好”结尾。

Ashamnu 和理性之道有着惊人的相似之处：理性之道就是要捶胸顿足地说，“我们都有偏见，我们都不理性，我们信息不全，我们自信过头，我们校准很差……”

很好。现在请告诉我，你打算如何变得更少偏见、更理性、信息更充分、更少自负、更好校准。

有个老犹太笑话：赎罪日时，拉比突然感到一阵愧疚，俯身大喊：“上帝啊，我在你面前什么都不是！”唱诗班长也被愧疚感击中，大喊：“上帝啊，我在你面前什么都不是！”这时，犹太教堂后排的清洁工也俯身大喊：“上帝啊，我在你面前什么都不是！”拉比悄悄推了推唱诗班长，低声说：“你看谁觉得自己什么都不是了。”

不要为自己也有偏见而自鸣得意；不要因自知有缺陷而沾沾自喜。这就像不该以无知为傲一样；如果你以无知为荣，当证据出现时你就会不愿放弃无知。同理，对自身缺陷的自省也不该成为炫耀的资本；真正值得高兴的，是你有一天需要忏悔的东西变少了。

否则，当有人带着纠正偏见的方案出现时，你会怒斥：“你以为你比我们高明？”你会悲伤地摇头说：“你一定不够自省。”

除非你能告诉我你打算怎么做，否则别跟我说你和我一样有缺陷。之后你依然会有很多缺陷，但那不是重点；重点是要做得更好，不断前进，再迈出一步。Tsuyoku naritai！

## Tsuyoku Naritai! (I Want to Become Stronger)

In Orthodox Judaism there is a saying: “The previous generation is to the next one as angels are to men; the next generation is to the previous one as donkeys are to men.” This follows from the Orthodox Jewish belief that all Judaic law was given to Moses by God at Mount Sinai. After all, it’s not as if you could do an experiment to gain new halachic knowledge; the only way you can know is if someone tells you (who heard it from someone else, who heard it from God). Since there is no new source of information; it can only be degraded in transmission from generation to generation.

Thus, modern rabbis are not allowed to overrule ancient rabbis. Crawly things are ordinarily unkosher, but it is permissible to eat a worm found in an apple—the ancient rabbis believed the worm was spontaneously generated inside the apple, and therefore was part of the apple. A modern rabbi cannot say, “Yeah, well, the ancient rabbis knew diddly-squat about biology. Overruled!” A modern rabbi cannot possibly know a halachic principle the ancient rabbis did not, because how could the ancient rabbis have passed down the answer from Mount Sinai to him? Knowledge derives from authority, and therefore is only ever lost, not gained, as time passes.

When I was first exposed to the angels-and-donkeys proverb in (religious) elementary school, I was not old enough to be a full-blown atheist, but I still thought to myself: “Torah loses knowledge in every generation. Science gains knowledge with every generation. No matter where they started out, sooner or later science must surpass Torah.”

The most important thing is that there should be progress. So long as you keep moving forward you will reach your destination; but if you stop moving you will never reach it.

Tsuyoku naritai is Japanese. Tsuyoku is “strong”; naru is “becoming,” and the form naritai is “want to become.” Together it means, “I want to become stronger,” and it expresses a sentiment embodied more intensely in Japanese works than in any Western literature I’ve read. You might say it when expressing your determination to become a professional Go player—or after you lose an important match, but you haven’t given up—or after you win an important match, but you’re not a ninth-dan player yet—or after you’ve become the greatest Go player of all time, but you still think you can do better. That is tsuyoku naritai, the will to transcendence.

Each year on Yom Kippur, an Orthodox Jew recites a litany which begins Ashamnu, bagadnu, gazalnu, dibarnu dofi, and goes on through the entire Hebrew alphabet: We have acted shamefully, we have betrayed, we have stolen, we have slandered . . .

As you pronounce each word, you strike yourself over the heart in penitence. There’s no exemption whereby, if you manage to go without stealing all year long, you can skip the word gazalnu and strike yourself one less time. That would violate the community spirit of Yom Kippur, which is about confessing sins—not avoiding sins so that you have less to confess.

By the same token, the Ashamnu does not end, “But that was this year, and next year I will do better.”

The Ashamnu bears a remarkable resemblance to the notion that the way of rationality is to beat your fist against your heart and say, “We are all biased, we are all irrational, we are not fully informed, we are overconfident, we are poorly calibrated . . .”

Fine. Now tell me how you plan to become less biased, less irrational, more informed, less overconfident, better calibrated.

There is an old Jewish joke: During Yom Kippur, the rabbi is seized by a sudden wave of guilt, and prostrates himself and cries, “God, I am nothing before you!” The cantor is likewise seized by guilt, and cries, “God, I am nothing before you!” Seeing this, the janitor at the back of the synagogue prostrates himself and cries, “God, I am nothing before you!” And the rabbi nudges the cantor and whispers, “Look who thinks he’s nothing.”

Take no pride in your confession that you too are biased; do not glory in your self-awareness of your flaws. This is akin to the principle of not taking pride in confessing your ignorance; for if your ignorance is a source of pride to you, you may become loath to relinquish your ignorance when evidence comes knocking. Likewise with our flaws—we should not gloat over how self-aware we are for confessing them; the occasion for rejoicing is when we have a little less to confess.

Otherwise, when the one comes to us with a plan for correcting the bias, we will snarl, “Do you think to set yourself above us?” We will shake our heads sadly and say, “You must not be very self-aware.”

Never confess to me that you are just as flawed as I am unless you can tell me what you plan to do about it. Afterward you will still have plenty of flaws left, but that’s not the point; the important thing is to do better, to keep moving ahead, to take one more step forward. Tsuyoku naritai!
