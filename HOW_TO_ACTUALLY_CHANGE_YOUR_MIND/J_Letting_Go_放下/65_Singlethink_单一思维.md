## 单一思维

我清楚地记得自己开始理性主义之旅的那一刻。

那并不是在读《你一定在开玩笑吧，费曼先生》或其他任何关于理性的著作时；这些内容我只是觉得理所当然。真正的旅程，是当你发现自己现有的技艺中有巨大缺陷，并产生了改进的冲动，想要创造出超越书本上那些有用但不够完善的新技能时才开始的。

在我“前世”的最后时刻，我十五岁，正回味着一段年幼时自以为正义的回忆。那时的记忆已经很模糊了；我脑海里有个画面，但记不清具体几岁。我想大概六七岁，事情发生在夏令营。

事情的经过是这样的：一位青少年男辅导员让我们这些年纪更小的男孩排成一队，提议玩一个游戏：队尾的男孩要从大家胯下钻过去，钻的时候我们要拍打他的屁股，然后轮到下一个八岁的男孩依次进行。（也许只是我失去了童年的天真，但现在回想起来不禁觉得……）我拒绝参加这个游戏，于是被要求去角落里坐着。

这段拒绝拍打和被拍打的记忆，后来成了我很早就拒绝以伤害他人为乐的象征。那时的我不会为了拍别人一巴掌而付出被拍一巴掌的代价；不会为了伤害别人而让自己受伤。我拒绝参与一个负和游戏。

然而，在十五岁那年，我突然意识到事实并非如此。我当时的拒绝，并不是出于反对负和游戏的原则。我很早就知道囚徒困境，但七岁时还不懂这些。我拒绝，只是因为我不想被打，而去角落坐着是个可以接受的代价。

更重要的是，我意识到自己其实一直都知道这一点——真正的记忆一直潜藏在脑海的角落里，我的心智之眼只会一瞬间瞥见它，然后又移开视线。

在我踏上理性之路的第一步时，我捕捉到了这种感觉——把主观体验加以泛化——并对自己说：“原来把不想面对的真相塞进脑海角落的感觉就是这样！以后每次我这么做时都要注意到，并把所有角落都清理干净！”

我把这种训练称为“单一思维”（singlethink），借用了奥威尔的“双重思想”（doublethink）一词。在双重思想中，你会遗忘，然后忘记自己曾经遗忘。而在单一思维中，你会注意到自己在遗忘，然后重新记起。你会让自己的脑海里只保留一个非自相矛盾的念头。

“单一思维”是我创造的第一个新理性主义技能，这在书本上是没有读到过的。我并不认为它在学术上是原创的，但幸运的是，这并不是必须的。

哦，对了，我十五岁的自己很喜欢给事物命名。

确认偏误的可怕深度无穷无尽。虽然大脑的复杂性是有限的，但这种深度足以让人觉得仿佛永远没有尽头。你会不断发现（或读到）大脑用来把事情推到一边的新机制。

不过，我年少的自己，还是用那第一把扫帚清理了不少角落。

## Singlethink

I remember the exact moment when I began my journey as a rationalist.

It was not while reading Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman or any existing work upon rationality; for these I simply accepted as obvious. The journey begins when you see a great flaw in your existing art, and discover a drive to improve, to create new skills beyond the helpful but inadequate ones you found in books.

In the last moments of my first life, I was fifteen years old, and rehearsing a pleasantly self-righteous memory of a time when I was much younger. My memories this far back are vague; I have a mental image, but I don’t remember how old I was exactly. I think I was six or seven, and that the original event happened during summer camp.

What happened originally was that a camp counselor, a teenage male, got us much younger boys to form a line, and proposed the following game: the boy at the end of the line would crawl through our legs, and we would spank him as he went past, and then it would be the turn of the next eightyear-old boy at the end of the line. (Maybe it’s just that I’ve lost my youthful innocence, but I can’t help but wonder . . .) I refused to play this game, and was told to go sit in the corner.

This memory—of refusing to spank and be spanked—came to symbolize to me that even at this very early age I had refused to take joy in hurting others. That I would not purchase a spank on another’s butt, at the price of a spank on my own; would not pay in hurt for the opportunity to inflict hurt. I had refused to play a negative-sum game.

And then, at the age of fifteen, I suddenly realized that it wasn’t true. I hadn’t refused out of a principled stand against negative-sum games. I found out about the Prisoner’s Dilemma pretty early in life, but not at the age of seven. I’d refused simply because I didn’t want to get hurt, and standing in the corner was an acceptable price to pay for not getting hurt.

More importantly, I realized that I had always known this—that the real memory had always been lurking in a corner of my mind, my mental eye glancing at it for a fraction of a second and then looking away.

In my very first step along the Way, I caught the feeling—generalized over the subjective experience—and said, “So that’s what it feels like to shove an unwanted truth into the corner of my mind! Now I’m going to notice every time I do that, and clean out all my corners!”

This discipline I named singlethink, after Orwell’s doublethink. In doublethink, you forget, and then forget you have forgotten. In singlethink, you notice you are forgetting, and then you remember. You hold only a single non-contradictory thought in your mind at once.

“Singlethink” was the first new rationalist skill I created, which I had not read about in books. I doubt that it is original in the sense of academic priority, but this is thankfully not required. 

Oh, and my fifteen-year-old self liked to name things.

The terrifying depths of the confirmation bias go on and on. Not forever, for the brain is of finite complexity, but long enough that it feels like forever. You keep on discovering (or reading about) new mechanisms by which your brain shoves things out of the way.

But my young self swept out quite a few corners with that first broom.
