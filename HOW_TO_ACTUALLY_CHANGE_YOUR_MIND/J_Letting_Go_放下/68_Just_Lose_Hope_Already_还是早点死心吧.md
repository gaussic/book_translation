## 还是早点死心吧

Casey Serin 是一位24岁的网页程序员，之前没有任何房地产经验，却在不同州同时购买了八套房子，并在贷款申请中撒谎，最终欠下银行220万美元。他通过贷款多申请出超过房价的金额，把多余的钱花在生活开销和房地产培训班上。他似乎一直指望房市会涨。

但这还不是最可悲的部分。最可悲的是，他到现在还没有放弃。Casey Serin 不肯认输。他拒绝申请破产，也不愿找份工作；他仍然认为自己能靠房地产发大财。他继续花钱上培训班，还试图再贷款买第九套房。他觉得自己并没有失败，只是经历了一次学习。

这就是拒绝死心的下场。

这种行为看起来也许只是愚蠢，但它让我想起了两位诺贝尔奖得主——正是长期资本管理公司（LTCM）的默顿和斯科尔斯。

LTCM在最初三年赚得盆满钵满，但到了1998年，他们所利用的市场低效开始消失——因为其他人也学会了这套把戏，所以不再奏效。

LTCM拒绝死心。他们对40%的年回报上了瘾，为了抓住越来越微小的利润，不断加大杠杆。当一切开始失控时，LTCM的自有资本为47.2亿美元，杠杆高达1245亿美元，衍生品头寸更是高达1.25万亿美元。

每个行业都有自己的聪明法则——要学的技能和要遵守的规则各不相同。所以你也许会觉得，“理性”这种通用学问对现实成功没什么帮助。但在我看来，如何避免愚蠢在各行各业其实有很多共通之处。如果你想教会别人如何不把小错误变成大灾难，无论是对冲基金还是恋爱，诀窍几乎都是一样的：要准备好承认自己输了。

## Just Lose Hope Already

Casey Serin, a 24-year-old web programmer with no prior experience in real estate, owes banks 2.2 million dollars after lying on mortgage applications in order to simultaneously buy eight different houses in different states. He took cash out of the mortgage (applied for larger amounts than the price of the house) and spent the money on living expenses and real-estate seminars. He was expecting the market to go up, it seems.

That’s not even the sad part. The sad part is that he still hasn’t given up. Casey Serin does not accept defeat. He refuses to declare bankruptcy, or get a job; he still thinks he can make it big in real estate. He went on spending money on seminars. He tried to take out a mortgage on a ninth house. He hasn’t failed, you see, he’s just had a learning experience.

That’s what happens when you refuse to lose hope.

While this behavior may seem to be merely stupid, it also puts me in mind of two Nobel-Prize-winning economists . . . namely Merton and Scholes of Long-Term Capital Management.

While LTCM raked in giant profits over its first three years, in 1998 the inefficiences that LTCM were exploiting had started to vanish—other people knew about the trick, so it stopped working.

LTCM refused to lose hope. Addicted to 40% annual returns, they borrowed more and more leverage to exploit tinier and tinier margins. When everything started to go wrong for LTCM, they had equity of $4.72 billion, leverage of $124.5 billion, and derivative positions of $1.25 trillion.

Every profession has a different way to be smart—different skills to learn and rules to follow. You might therefore think that the study of “rationality,” as a general discipline, wouldn’t have much to contribute to real-life success. And yet it seems to me that how to not be stupid has a great deal in common across professions. If you set out to teach someone how to not turn little mistakes into big mistakes, it’s nearly the same art whether in hedge funds or romance, and one of the keys is this: Be ready to admit you lost.
