## 疯子之路的诱惑

我很小的时候——大概十三岁，也可能十四岁——曾以为自己找到了康托对角线论证的反例。那是一个著名的定理，证明了实数的数量多于有理数。啊，名声与荣耀的美梦在我脑海中翩翩起舞！

我的想法是，既然每个整数都可以分解为若干个2的幂的组合，那么只需写出二进制展开，就能把所有整数映射到整数子集的集合上。比如13的二进制是1101，就对应于{0, 2, 3}。过了一整周，我才想到也许应该用康托的对角线论证来检验一下我的巧妙构造，结果当然发现了反例——无限的二进制数（……1111），它并不对应于任何有限的整数。

于是我找到了这个反例，也明白了自己的“反证”是错的，名声与荣耀的美梦也随之破灭。

起初我有点失望。

我心里想：“我迟早会搞定这个定理的！哪怕这次失败了，总有一天我会推翻康托的对角线论证！”我对这个定理固执地为真感到不满，觉得它剥夺了我的名声和财富，于是开始寻找其他反证方法。

然后我意识到了一件事。我意识到自己犯了个错误，而既然我已经发现了这个错误，就完全没有理由再怀疑康托对角线论证的可靠性——它和其他数学大定理一样坚固。

我当时非常清楚地意识到，自己正面临着成为“数学疯子”的机会——那种一辈子用绿色墨水给数学教授写愤怒信件的人。（我以前看过一本讲数学疯子的书。）

我不想让这成为我的未来，于是轻轻一笑，放下了执念。我带着美好的祝愿让康托对角线论证继续前行，从此再也没有质疑过它。

我现在已经记不清，是当时就有这个想法，还是后来才想到的……但对一个十三岁的孩子来说，这实在是个不公平的考验。你必须在那个年纪就足够理性，否则就会失败。

你越聪明，可能越早会有那种看起来像是革命性想法的时刻。幸运的是，我自己发现了错误；而不是等另一个数学家来指出，让我有机会把责任推给外部。幸运的是，这个反证足够简单，我能理解。也许否则我最终也能走出来。成年后我也从更糟糕的错误中恢复过来。但如果我那么早就走错了路，我还能培养出这种能力吗？

我想知道，有多少用绿色墨水写愤怒信的人，是在十三岁时迈出了那致命的第一步？又有多少人在那之前曾是很有前途的头脑？

我犯了个错误，仅此而已。我并没有在内心深处真的对；我没有获得道德上的胜利；我没有展现出雄心、怀疑精神或其他任何美德；这不是个合理的错误；我既不是对了一半，甚至连一丁点都没对。如果我更有智慧，这个念头根本不会出现在脑海里，仅此而已。

如果我不能承认这一点，如果我把自己的错误美化为美德，如果我为了自尊坚持自己至少有点道理，那我就不会放下。我会继续寻找对角线论证的漏洞。迟早，我可能真的会找到一个。

在你承认自己错了之前，你无法继续前行；你的自我形象还会被困在那个旧错误里。

每当你想要执着于一个如果更有智慧就不会产生的念头时，你就正面临着成为疯子的机会——哪怕你从未用绿色墨水写过愤怒信。即使没人和你争论，甚至你从未把想法告诉别人，你也可能已经是个疯子。关键就在于那份执着。

它不是真的。它在内心深处也不是真的。它不是一半对，甚至不是一点点对。它只不过是一个你本不该有的念头。不是每朵乌云都有银边。人类会犯错，并不是所有错误都伪装成了成功。人类会犯错，这很正常，仅此而已。说声“哎呀”，然后继续生活吧。

## The Crackpot Offer

When I was very young—I think thirteen or maybe fourteen—I thought I had found a disproof of Cantor’s Diagonal Argument, a famous theorem which demonstrates that the real numbers outnumber the rational numbers. Ah, the dreams of fame and glory that danced in my head!

My idea was that since each whole number can be decomposed into a bag of powers of 2, it was possible to map the whole numbers onto the set of subsets of whole numbers simply by writing out the binary expan- sion. The number 13, for example, 1101, would map onto {0, 2, 3}. It took a whole week before it occurred to me that perhaps I should apply Can- tor’s Diagonal Argument to my clever construction, and of course it found a counterexample—the binary number (. . . 1111), which does not correspond to any finite whole number.

So I found this counterexample, and saw that my attempted disproof was false, along with my dreams of fame and glory.

I was initially a bit disappointed.

The thought went through my mind: “I’ll get that theorem eventually! Someday I’ll disprove Cantor’s Diagonal Argument, even though my first try failed!” I resented the theorem for being obstinately true, for depriving me of my fame and fortune, and I began to look for other disproofs.

And then I realized something. I realized that I had made a mistake, and that, now that I’d spotted my mistake, there was absolutely no reason to suspect the strength of Cantor’s Diagonal Argument any more than other major theorems of mathematics.

I saw then very clearly that I was being offered the opportunity to become a math crank, and to spend the rest of my life writing angry letters in green ink to math professors. (I’d read a book once about math cranks.)

I did not wish this to be my future, so I gave a small laugh, and let it go. I waved Cantor’s Diagonal Argument on with all good wishes, and I did not question it again.

And I don’t remember, now, if I thought this at the time, or if I thought it afterward . . . but what a terribly unfair test to visit upon a child of thirteen. That I had to be that rational, already, at that age, or fail.

The smarter you are, the younger you may be, the first time you have what looks to you like a really revolutionary idea. I was lucky in that I saw the mistake myself; that it did not take another mathematician to point it out to me, and perhaps give me an outside source to blame. I was lucky in that the disproof was simple enough for me to understand. Maybe I would have recovered eventually, otherwise. I’ve recovered from much worse, as an adult. But if I had gone wrong that early, would I ever have developed that skill?

I wonder how many people writing angry letters in green ink were thirteen when they made that first fatal misstep. I wonder how many were promising minds before then.

I made a mistake. That was all. I was not really right, deep down; I did not win a moral victory; I was not displaying ambition or skepticism or any other wondrous virtue; it was not a reasonable error; I was not half right or even the tiniest fraction right. I thought a thought I would never have thought if I had been wiser, and that was all there ever was to it.

If I had been unable to admit this to myself, if I had reinterpreted my mistake as virtuous, if I had insisted on being at least a little right for the sake of pride, then I would not have let go. I would have gone on looking for a flaw in the Diagonal Argument. And, sooner or later, I might have found one.

Until you admit you were wrong, you cannot get on with your life; your self-image will still be bound to the old mistake.

Whenever you are tempted to hold on to a thought you would never have thought if you had been wiser, you are being offered the opportunity to become a crackpot—even if you never write any angry letters in green ink. If no one bothers to argue with you, or if you never tell anyone your idea, you may still be a crackpot. It’s the clinging that defines it.

It’s not true. It’s not true deep down. It’s not half-true or even a little true. It’s nothing but a thought you should never have thought. Not every cloud has a silver lining. Human beings make mistakes, and not all of them are disguised successes. Human beings make mistakes; it happens, that’s all. Say “oops,” and get on with your life.
