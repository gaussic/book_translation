## 留一条退路

围敌时，  
务必给他们留一条生路。  
他们必须看到，  
死亡之外还有别的选择。  
——孙子，《孙子兵法》

不要加高压力，而要降低墙壁。  
——洛伊斯·麦克马斯特·布约尔德，《科马尔》

最近我偶然和一位非理性主义者聊了聊，她不知怎么闯进了本地理性主义者的聚会。她刚刚表达了两点观点：（a）她相信灵魂的存在；（b）她不相信人体冷冻术，因为她认为灵魂不会留在被冷冻的身体里。我问她：“但你怎么知道的呢？”

她脸上闪过的困惑表情，很明显说明她从没想过这个问题。我并不是在贬低她——她看起来是个很友善的人，只是没有受过理性思维训练，就像大多数普通人一样。

接下来的大部分对话内容，其实在 Overcoming Bias 上都讨论过了——比如，如果你真的对某事好奇，你大概能想到好的检验方法，应该先追求准确的信念，然后再让情感随之而来，诸如此类。但这次谈话让我想起了一个我还没在这里讲过的观点：

我建议她说：“你要确保自己能想象一下，如果没有灵魂，世界会是什么样，你会怎么做。不要去想为什么不可能那样，而是把它当作前提，设想一下后果。这样你会想，‘如果没有灵魂，那我就可以去签人体冷冻了’，或者‘如果没有上帝，我还是可以继续做个道德的人’，而不是觉得这种设想太可怕无法面对。出于自尊，你应该努力相信真相，无论它多么让人不舒服，就像我之前说的；但从人性角度讲，在你评估证据之前，先让这个信念变得没那么难以接受，会更容易一些。”

这项技巧背后的原理很简单：正如孙子教你对待敌人时要做的，你也要对自己这样——给自己留一条退路，这样你撤退时就不会那么困难。比如说，失业的前景在你连想都不敢想时会显得极其可怕，但如果你算清楚自己的存款能撑多久，查查本地的就业市场，规划好下一步要做什么，恐惧就会小很多。只有这样，你才能公平地评估下个月裁员时自己能否保住工作的概率。做个真正的“胆小鬼”，提前详细规划好退路——最好在你真正上战场之前，就把每一步都想清楚。

希望是：把不舒服的情形当作思想实验来设想，比直接考虑它有多大可能是真的，要容易一些。但一旦你做了前者，后者也会变得容易。

记住，贝叶斯主义是精确的——即使某个可怕的命题真的很不可能，你也必须把所有证据都公平计入，得出理性的概率。想象一个可怕的信念，并不意味着你内心深处其实觉得它很可能是真的。你可以出于良好的心理卫生原则去设想可怕的信念。“你无法思考的念头，比你能说出口的念头更能控制你”——即使那个不可思议的念头其实是假的，这种现象也会发生！

“留退路”这项技巧要正确使用，确实需要一定的自我诚实。

首先：你至少要能对自己承认，哪些想法让你害怕，哪些想法你很执着。但这比起要你公平地统计那些让你害怕的想法的证据，已经容易多了。顺便说一句，我自己也经常用这个技巧，这样说你会不会觉得好受点？毕竟理性主义者并不是要拒绝所有情感。有些想法让我害怕，但我依然相信它是假的。有些想法我明知自己很执着，但我依然相信它是真的。但我还是会提前规划退路，不是因为我真的打算撤退，而是因为提前规划退路能让我不带执念地思考问题。

但更高层次的自我诚实，是要真的把那个让你不舒服的命题当作前提，认真思考如果它是真的你会怎么办。当我们面对一个让人不舒服的想法时，第一反应往往是想尽一切理由证明它不可能为真。所以，如果你试图设想“如果我最珍视的信念是错的”或者“如果我最害怕的信念是真的”，你会在内心遇到一定的心理阻力。

想想那些说“没有上帝就没有道德”的人。<sup>1</sup> 如果有神论者能真实设想自己相信“上帝不存在”这个事实时的反应，他们会发现，自己其实不会去杀婴儿。他们会发现，无神论者面对上帝不存在时的反应，其实和他们自己如果相信那样时的反应差不多。我举这个例子，是想说明：设想自己真的会如何反应于一个与自己核心信念相反的事实，其实是很难的。

而且，人们总是很难直觉地意识到：是的，人是能走出来的。新近截瘫的人，六个月后并没有他们预想的那么悲伤，等等。同样难以直觉接受的是：如果那个可怕的信念真的成真，你最终也会想办法接受它。截瘫者能适应，你也一样。

还可以参考根德林祷文和塔尔斯基祷文。真实的事物已经如此；承认它并不会让事情变得更糟。你不必害怕去设想你所恐惧的世界。如果那个世界已经成真，设想它不会让情况更糟；如果它并不真实，设想它也不会有坏处。记住，在你设想时，如果你想象的那些可怕的事真的成真了——当然也可能并不会！——那你确实应该希望自己相信它是真的，你也应该设想这一点；不相信并不会帮到你。

如果宗教信仰者能准确设想那个“没有上帝、自己变成无神论者”的假想世界，会有多少人还能保有对上帝的信仰？

“留退路”是一项强大的技巧，但并不容易。诚实地设想，并不像直接承认“上帝不存在”那么难，但也确实需要努力。

## Leave a Line of Retreat

When you surround the enemy  
Always allow them an escape route.  
They must see that there is  
An alternative to death.  
—Sun Tzu, The Art of War

Don’t raise the pressure, lower the wall.  
—Lois McMaster Bujold, Komarr

I recently happened into a conversation with a nonrationalist who had somehow wandered into a local rationalists’ gathering. She had just declared (a) her belief in souls and (b) that she didn’t believe in cryonics because she believed the soul wouldn’t stay with the frozen body. I asked, “But how do you know that?”

From the confusion that flashed on her face, it was pretty clear that this question had never occurred to her. I don’t say this in a bad way—she seemed like a nice person without any applied rationality training, just like most of the rest of the human species.

Most of the ensuing conversation was on items already covered on Overcoming Bias—if you’re really curious about something, you probably can figure out a good way to test it, try to attain accurate beliefs first and then let your emotions flow from that, that sort of thing. But the conversation reminded me of one notion I haven’t covered here yet:

“Make sure,” I suggested to her, “that you visualize what the world would be like if there are no souls, and what you would do about that. Don’t think about all the reasons that it can’t be that way; just accept it as a premise and then visualize the consequences. So that you’ll think, ‘Well, if there are no souls, I can just sign up for cryonics,’ or ‘If there is no God, I can just go on being moral anyway,’ rather than it being too horrifying to face. As a matter of self-respect, you should try to believe the truth no matter how uncomfortable it is, like I said before; but as a matter of human nature, it helps to make a belief less uncomfortable, before you try to evaluate the evidence for it.”

The principle behind the technique is simple: as Sun Tzu advises you to do with your enemies, you must do with yourself—leave yourself a line of retreat, so that you will have less trouble retreating. The prospect of losing your job, for example, may seem a lot more scary when you can’t even bear to think about it than after you have calculated exactly how long your savings will last, and checked the job market in your area, and otherwise planned out exactly what to do next. Only then will you be ready to fairly assess the probability of keeping your job in the planned layoffs next month. Be a true coward, and plan out your retreat in detail—visualize every step—preferably before you first come to the battlefield.

The hope is that it takes less courage to visualize an uncomfortable state of affairs as a thought experiment, than to consider how likely it is to be true. But then after you do the former, it becomes easier to do the latter.

Remember that Bayesianism is precise—even if a scary proposition really should seem unlikely, it’s still important to count up all the evidence, for and against, exactly fairly, to arrive at the rational quantitative probability. Visualizing a scary belief does not mean admitting that you think, deep down, it’s probably true. You can visualize a scary belief on general principles of good mental housekeeping. “The thought you cannot think controls you more than thoughts you speak aloud”—this happens even if the unthinkable thought is false!

The leave-a-line-of-retreat technique does require a certain minimum of self-honesty to use correctly.

For a start: You must at least be able to admit to yourself which ideas scare you, and which ideas you are attached to. But this is a substantially less difficult test than fairly counting the evidence for an idea that scares you. Does it help if I say that I have occasion to use this technique myself? A rationalist does not reject all emotion, after all. There are ideas which scare me, yet I still believe to be false. There are ideas to which I know I am attached, yet I still believe to be true. But I still plan my retreats, not because I’m planning to retreat, but because planning my retreat in advance helps me think about the problem without attachment.

But the greater test of self-honesty is to really accept the uncomfortable proposition as a premise, and figure out how you would really deal with it. When we’re faced with an uncomfortable idea, our first impulse is naturally to think of all the reasons why it can’t possibly be so. And so you will encounter a certain amount of psychological resistance in yourself, if you try to visualize exactly how the world would be, and what you would do about it, if My-Most-Precious-Belief were false, or My-Most-Feared-Belief were true.

Think of all the people who say that without God, morality is impossible.<sup>1</sup> If theists could visualize their real reaction to believing as a fact that God did not exist, they could realize that, no, they wouldn’t go around slaughtering babies. They could realize that atheists are reacting to the nonexistence of God in pretty much the way they themselves would, if they came to believe that. I say this, to show that it is a considerable challenge to visualize the way you really would react, to believing the opposite of a tightly held belief.

Plus it’s always counterintuitive to realize that, yes, people do get over things. Newly minted quadriplegics are not as sad, six months later, as they expect to be, etc. It can be equally counterintuitive to realize that if the scary belief turned out to be true, you would come to terms with it somehow. Quadriplegics deal, and so would you.

See also the Litany of Gendlin and the Litany of Tarski. What is true is already so; owning up to it doesn’t make it worse. You shouldn’t be afraid to just visualize a world you fear. If that world is already actual, visualizing it won’t make it worse; and if it is not actual, visualizing it will do no harm. And remember, as you visualize, that if the scary things you’re imagining really are true—which they may not be!—then you would, indeed, want to believe it, and you should visualize that too; not believing wouldn’t help you.

How many religious people would retain their belief in God if they could accurately visualize that hypothetical world in which there was no God and they themselves have become atheists?

Leaving a line of retreat is a powerful technique, but it’s not easy. Honest visualization doesn’t take as much effort as admitting outright that God doesn’t exist, but it does take an effort.
